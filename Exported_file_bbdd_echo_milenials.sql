They have released three albums, \"Let\'s Get Free\" (2000),  \"Revolutionary But Gangsta\" (2004), and \"Information Age\" (2012). The duo has also released several mixtapes.\n\nThey are known for their sometimes confrontational style, combined with socialist lyrics focused on both militant social justice, and also positivity. The duo maintains an ethical stance against corporate control over the media, especially hip-hop record labels.',576729,7899053),(2,'Static-X','Static-X was formed in 1994 from the ashes of Wayne Static and Ken Jay\'s former band, Deep Blue Dream. After searching for members in Chicago, IL, Static and Jay decided to go to Los Angeles to continue their search. There they met Tony Campos from the Mexican death metal band Asesino, and Koichi Fukuda, completing the band\'s original line-up. Static-X signed with Warner Brothers Records in early 1998.\n\nThe band\'s debut album, Wisconsin Death Trip, was released March 23, 1999. Notable songs from the album include Push It, I\'m With Stupid, Bled For Days, and Fix. Static-X\'s touring schedule in support of the album included two Ozzfest stints. The following year saw the release of the little-known EP The Death Trip Continues, and the band contributed the song \"Otsegolation\" to the PlayStation video game Omega Boost. Push It also appeared on the Playstation video games Street Skater 2 & Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes.\n\nAfter recording their follow-up album Machine, guitarist Koichi Fukuda left the band to spend time with his family and pursue other musical opportunities. Tripp Eisen, formerly of Dope, stepped in as Fukuda\'s replacement. Machine was released May 22, 2001.\n\nStatic-X quickly began work on their third album Shadow Zone, this time with Eisen performing and writing on the album. Before they started recording, however, Ken Jay left the band due to \"political differences.\" Josh Freese of A Perfect Circle was brought in to drum on the album, and Nick Oshiro, formerly of Seether, was later selected as Jay\'s replacement. Shadow Zone was released October 7, 2003, and July 20, 2004 saw the release of Beneath... Between... Beyond..., a collection of rarities and demos. Later that year, Wayne did guest vocals on the Skinny Puppy song Use Less.\n\nShortly after the release of Beneath... Between... Beyond..., the band commenced work on their fourth studio album, Start a War. In February of 2005, Tripp Eisen was arrested in a sex scandal involving minors, and was fired from Static-X shortly after. Former guitarist Koichi Fukuda, who had been mixing the new album, rejoined Static-X to fill the vacancy left by Eisen. Start a War was released June 14, 2005.\n\nCannibal, released on April 3, 2007, marked the studio return of their original guitarist, Koichi Fukuda. One of the new tracks called \"No Submission\" is available on the Saw III soundtrack. The full track has also been released on Static-X\'s MySpace page. \"Cannibal\" was released as a digital download single at iTunes. \"Destroyer\" was released as a lead off radio single, before the album was released. Videos for the singles were supposed to be taken at the same time.\n\nOn March 20, the upcoming album was preceded with an exclusive Destroyer EP. The video for \"Destroyer\" has also been produced and is available now at headbangersball.com. The album itself debuted at #36 in the U.S. with sales of over 30,000.\n\nOn May 10, 2007 it was announced that the band would be playing on the main stage at Ozzfest 2007. Additionally, in a recent interview, Wayne Static announced his side-project called \"Pighammer\". The chorus of the song \"Destroyer\" was used in an advertisement promoting the latest video game in the WWE franchise, Smackdown vs. Raw 2008.\n\nIn November 2007, Tony Campos joined legendary industrial act Ministry as a temporary touring bassist for Ministry\'s C U LaTour in the wake of Paul Raven\'s death.\n\nThe band began their sixth studio album, Cult of Static, in January 2008 after returning from the Operation Annihilation tour in Australia. In a posting at the Static-X message boards Wayne Static said that this time around he is focusing on longer buildups and break downs like in the Wisconsin Death Trip days of the band, however the album still maintains the heaviness that was present on Cannibal.\n\nOn October 14, 2008 Static-X released their much anticipated live CD/DVD, Cannibal Killers Live. On December 11, 2008 Wayne Static confirmed on the Static-X Message Board the new album\'s release date and name saying \"I had hoped to announce it here first, but my publicist beat me to the punch! The new record is indeed entitled \"Cult of Static\" and will be released March 17. The \"cult\" part of the title is not to be taken in any religious manner, I am referring to and giving respect to the loyalty of all you good people that have supported us through the years. This record is definitely darker than Cannibal and has more synths and loops as well. And this is also the most crushing guitar tone I have ever had. There are 11 songs instead of our usual 12, and they are mostly longer and more epic than ever before.\" The album debut at #16 on the Billboard 200 chart, the highest a Static-X album has ever been since their second studio album, Machine.  A new Static-X song called \"Lunatic\" appeared on soundtrack to the movie Punisher: War Zone.\n\nIn 2009, the band performed at the Download Festival. It also was the first time the band made an appearance at Rock on the Range.After finishing their final tour dates in Australia at the end of 2009, Wayne Static announced on the band\'s official X-Boards that he will now be focusing on his side project Pighammer. In a follow up post he was quoted \"It\'s doubtful I will do anything with Static-X for the next couple years\" leading fans to interpret that the band is still together and just on hiatus.\n\nLater, he revealed that Tony Campos had left the band, and Campos has since joined the metal band Soulfly, taking over from Bobby Burns. Koichi Fukuda went on to join industrial metal / ambient band Drugstore Fanatics.\n\nIn 2010, Wayne Static has been confirmed for Graspop Metal Meeting 2011 as part of his \'Pighammer\' solo project. He released his debut solo album \"Pighammer on October 4, 2011.\n\nIn 2012 Wayne Static decided to reform Static-X, but none of the original members will join him. Instead his solo band will tour under the name Static-X.\n\nThe band\'s musical styles are industrial metal, alternative metal, and occasionally nu metal. But the band rejected the nu metal label and they also call their music as \"evil disco\". The band are influenced by metal and industrial bands like Ministry and Fear Factory.\n\nOn 1st of November 2014, news surfaced of Wayne Static\'s death. At this point no formal reason has been published for his passing. \nStatic died on November 1, 2014 in Landers, California, three days before his 49th birthday. He had consumed half of an oxycodone pill as well as alcohol that morning before going to bed with his wife Tera Wray. She woke up later that day to find that he had died in his sleep. His family issued a statement stating that rumors of his death being drug-related were false, noting that he and Wray had stopped using illicit drugs in 2009. An autopsy later confirmed that Static had died of multiple prescription drug toxicity, consisting of the painkillers oxycodone, hydromorphone, and the anti-anxiety medication alprazolam combined with alcohol, though the report also noted that years of past \"chronic prescription drug and alcohol abuse\" was a contributing factor.\n\nFormer Static-X members Koichi Fukuda and Tony Campos paid tribute to Static. Static was cremated in California. A memorial rock show followed in Los Angeles, and a family service followed in Illinois. In 2019 it was announced that a new Static-X album would be coming out with a new lead singer named \"Xer0\", who is rumored to be Edsel Dope from the band Dope.\n\nStatic-X released an album titled “Project Regeneration Vol. 1” on July 10, 2020 that features completed tracks that use demos of Wayne’s voice. The original band lineup, minus Wayne Static, contributed to this album as a tribute to Wayne. There are a few songs with the entity, Xer0, involved and one featuring Al Jourgensen from the industrial metal band Ministry. Ulrich Wild returned to produce this album along with Edsel Dope.\n\nAfter multiple pushed back dates, another album called “Project Regeneration Vol. 2” was released on January 26, 2024. It features the last of Wayne’s unfinished vocal demos as well as some Xer0 original tracks. This is the final volume of Project Regeneration.\n\nMembers\nXero – vocals, lead guitar (2019-present)\nTony Campos – bass, backing vocals (1994–present)\nKoichi Fukuda – lead guitars (1994–2000, 2005–present)\nKen Jay – drums, percussion (1994–2002, 2019-present)\n\nFormer\nWayne Static – lead vocals, rhythm guitars, keyboards, programming (1994–2014)\nAshes – lead guitars (2012–2014)\nBrent Ashley – bass (2012–2014)\nSean Davidson – drums, percussion (2012–2014)\nTripp Eisen – lead guitars (2001–2005)\nNick Oshiro – drums, percussion (2003–2012)',1556377,44944804),(3,'Souchi','',3184,28558),(4,'Up, Bustle & Out','Name variation for Up, Bustle and Out',78529,764048),(5,'Selektah Kolektiboa','Selektah Kolektiboa is a music group and, at the same time, an open-ended project aimed at making black music, with its myriad of faces and styles. Apart from organisation of fiestas and working as a sound system, it is the pioneering group for hip-hop in Basque.',1422,16486),(6,'Lords of the Underground','The Lords of the Underground (L.O.T.U.G.) is a hip-hop trio based in Newark, New Jersey. MCs Mr. Funke and DoItAll Dupré met DJ Lord Jazz (a native of Cleveland) when all three were undergraduates at Shaw University[citation needed]. Fellow New Jersey rapper Redman served as one of the group\'s early DJ\'s.\n\nThe group released their debut album, Here Come the Lords on March 9, 1993 with production handled by Marley Marl and K-Def. The album peaked at 66 on the Billboard 200 and featured five charting singles, including the group\'s signature song, \"Chief Rocka\".\n\nThe group released their second album, Keepers of the Funk the following year on November 1, 1994. Keepers of the Funk peaked at 47 on the Billboard 200 and featured three charting singles, the most successful of which was \"Tic Toc\". As stated in a 2013 interview, the group had never disbanded.\n\nThey reunited for a third album with 1999\'s Resurrection. Released via Queen Latifah\'s Jersey Kidz imprint, was so small-scale a release that few realized it had been recorded. The Lords returned again in 2007 for a fourth album entitled House of Lords, but like Resurrection, it failed to reach the Billboard charts.\n\nThe Lords are best remembered in connection with the golden age of hip hop. As such, when Nas decided in 2007 to do a remix of his song \"Where Are They Now?\", which asked of the fates of several long-forgotten golden age rappers, the Lords were among those requested to appear. DoItAll Dupré performed eight bars on the track.\n\nDoItAll appeared briefly in the final scene of the final episode of The Sopranos credited as Du Kelly, as one of a series of potentially ominous figures entering the diner. He also appeared on other TV shows; Law & Order as Two Tone, on Oz the HBO series, and on the Christmas episode of 30 Rock on NBC (2008). He has also been in independent movies such as Somewhere in the City with Bai Ling, Rhyme & Reason, and with Treach of Naughty By Nature. He has also starred in an off Broadway play entitled Diss, Diss, & Diss, Dat.\n\nIn 2017, DoItAll revealed he planned on running for Councilman at Large for his hometown of Newark.[1] He started his campaign in 2018, and despite not winning a seat still plans to help the city.[2]',265575,2472219),(7,'Busta Flex','Busta Flex is a French rapper. His influence is of many other French rappers. He has released 3 albums \"Busta Flex\", \"Sexe, Violence, Rap et Flouze\" and \"La Pièce Maîtresse\". He was born in Épinay-sur-Seine, Paris Region.\nHis 1 st album \"Busta Flex\" was recorded in 1998.',21941,211186),(8,'Gravediggaz','Gravediggaz was an American hip-hop group from New York City, known for its dark sense of humor and abrasive, menacing soundscapes. Gravediggaz blended hardcore hip hop, gangsta rap and heavy metal with horror elements to pioneer the hip-hop subgenre of horrorcore.\n\nThe group was formed in 1992, bringing together Prince Paul (The Undertaker), Frukwan (The Gatekeeper), Poetic (The Grym Reaper) and RZA (The RZArector). It came about largely due to the efforts of Prince Paul. Frukwan and Prince Paul were previously together in the group Stetsasonic. According to Frukwan, the group\'s name means \"digging graves of the mentally dead, and it stood for resurrecting the mentally dead from their state of unawareness and ignorance.\" The group\'s lyrics mix black humor (regarding topics such as suicide, death, killing, psychopathy, hell, etc.), criticism regarding the music industry, cartoonish violence reminiscent of the Geto Boys, and esoteric references to the Nation of Gods and Earths. The group pioneered the horrorcore genre.\n\nThe group\'s first album was originally to be titled Niggamortis; however, this potentially risqué title was changed to 6 Feet Deep for the American market (European versions of the album retained the original title, and also included the bonus track \"Pass the Shovel\"); it was released on August 9, 1994. The four members adopted Gravedigga alter egos for their work with the group: RZA became The RZArector, Poetic became The Grym Reaper, Prince Paul became The Undertaker, and Frukwan became The Gatekeeper. In 1995, the three rapping members (without Prince Paul) released a collaborative EP titled \"The_Hell_E.P.\" with UK trip hop artist Tricky.\n\nThe second full-length Gravediggaz album The Pick, the Sickle and the Shovel was less humorous, dealing more with social and political issues; it also used calmer and more conventional production. Prince Paul played a considerably smaller role in the making of this album, with many of the production duties now taken care of by RZA and his Wu-Tang affiliates (including True Master and 4th Disciple).\n\nA bootleg Gravediggaz album surfaced in 1998, called Scenes From The Graveyard. It featured seven unreleased tracks plus some remixes from the first two albums.\n\nGravediggaz recruited DJ Diamond J. Poetic died of colon cancer in July 2001. Frukwan stated in an interview not long after Poetic\'s death that a new album using leftover Poetic material would be released. Nightmare in A-Minor, the third official album for Gravediggaz, came out in 2001; it featured two of the original members, Poetic and Frukwan. This album was their darkest work yet, including many references to Poetic\'s struggle with cancer, as well as apocalyptic themes to do with the teachings of the Five Percent Nation. Although RZA did not take part in the album, some Wu-Tang Clan affiliates such as 4th Disciple, True Master and Beretta 9 were involved. The album was mostly produced by Poetic and Frukwan. A different version of the album (minus the song \"Better Wake Up\") was released in 2002, for which some of the tracks created by Poetic were replaced or altered.\n\nIn 2003 Frukwan released his debut solo album, Life. The fourth Gravediggaz album 6 Feet Under was released in 2004 by Cleopatra Records and featured songs from Nightmare in A-Minor and Life. According to Frukwan, he had nothing to do with the release and claimed that song titles were changed without permission, making it an unauthorized release.\n\nIn 2010, Gravediggaz recorded a new song, \"2 More Cups of Blood\". In 2011, it was announced that the group had been recording new tracks involving Shabazz The Disciple & Killah Priest.\n\nIn 2018, Gatekeeper released \"1 Cup of Blood\" under the Gravediggaz name.',314846,4575590),(9,'Morau','',63,584),(10,'The Notorious B.I.G.','Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 – March 9, 1997), known professionally as The Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or Biggie, was an American rapper. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.\n\nWallace was born and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His debut album Ready to Die (1994) made him a central figure in East Coast hip hop and increased New York City\'s visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop dominated the mainstream. The following year, he led Junior M.A.F.I.A.—a protégé group composed of his childhood friends—to chart success. In 1996, while recording his second album, Wallace was heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud. On March 9, 1997, he was murdered by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. His second album, Life After Death (1997), released two weeks later, rose to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. In 2000, it became one of the few hip-hop albums to be certified Diamond.\n\nWallace was noted for his \"loose, easy flow\"; dark, semi-autobiographical lyrics; and storytelling abilities, which focused on crime and hardship. Three more albums have been released since his death, and he has certified sales of over 17 million records in the United States, including 13.4 million albums.\n\nWallace was born at St. Mary\'s Hospital in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on May 21, 1972, the only child of Jamaican immigrant parents. His mother, Voletta Wallace, was a preschool teacher, while his father, Selwyn George Latore, was a welder and politician. His father left the family when Wallace was two years old, and his mother worked two jobs while raising him. Wallace grew up at 226 St. James Place in Brooklyn\'s Clinton Hill, near the border with Bedford-Stuyvesant. Wallace excelled at Queen of All Saints Middle School winning several awards as an English student. He was nicknamed \"Big\" because he was overweight by the age of 10. Wallace said he started dealing drugs when he was around the age of 12. His mother, often away at work, did not know of his drug dealing until he was an adult. He began rapping as a teenager, entertaining people on the streets, and performed with local groups the Old Gold Brothers and the Techniques. At his request, Wallace transferred from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School to George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, where future rappers DMX, Jay-Z, and Busta Rhymes were also attending. According to his mother, Wallace was still a good student but developed a \"smart-ass\" attitude at the new school. At age 17, Wallace dropped out of school and became more involved in crime. In 1989, he was arrested on weapons charges in Brooklyn and sentenced to five years\' probation. In 1990, he was arrested on a violation of his probation. A year later, Wallace was arrested in North Carolina for dealing crack cocaine. He spent nine months in jail before making bail.\n\nWallace\'s lyrical topics and themes included mafioso tales (\"Niggas Bleed\"), his drug-dealing past (\"10 Crack Commandments\"), materialistic bragging (\"Hypnotize\"), as well as humor (\"Just Playing (Dreams)\"), and romance (\"Me & My Bitch\"). Rolling Stone named Wallace in 2004 as \"one of the few young male songwriters in any pop style writing credible love songs\".\n\nGuerilla Black, in the book How to Rap, describes how Wallace was able to both \"glorify the upper echelon\" and \"[make] you feel his struggle\". According to Touré of The New York Times in 1994, Wallace\'s lyrics \" autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty\". Marriott of The New York Times (in 1997) believed his lyrics were not strictly autobiographical and wrote he \"had a knack for exaggeration that increased sales\". Wallace described his debut as \"a big pie, with each slice indicating a different point in my life involving bitches and niggaz... from the beginning to the end\".\n\nReady to Die is described by Rolling Stone as a contrast of \"bleak\" street visions and being \"full of high-spirited fun, bringing the pleasure principle back to hip-hop\". AllMusic write of \"a sense of doom\" in some of his songs and the NY Times note some being \"laced with paranoia\"; Wallace described himself as feeling \"broke and depressed\" when he made his debut. The final song on the album, \"Suicidal Thoughts\", featured Wallace contemplating suicide and concluded with him committing the act.\n\nOn Life After Death, Wallace\'s lyrics went \"deeper\". Krims explains how upbeat, dance-oriented tracks (which featured less heavily on his debut) alternate with \"reality rap\" songs on the record and suggests that he was \"going pimp\" through some of the lyrical topics of the former. XXL magazine wrote that Wallace \"revamped his image\" through the portrayal of himself between the albums, going from \"midlevel hustler\" on his debut to \"drug lord\".\n\nAllMusic wrote that the success of Ready to Die is \"mostly due to Wallace\'s skill as a storyteller\"; in 1994, Rolling Stone described Wallace\'s ability in this technique as painting \"a sonic picture so vibrant that you\'re transported right to the scene\". On Life After Death, Wallace notably demonstrated this skill on \"I Got a Story to Tell\", creating a story as a rap for the first half of the song and then retelling the same story \"for his boys\" in conversation form.\n\nConsidered one of the best rappers of all time, Wallace was described by AllMusic as \"the savior of East Coast hip-hop\". The Source magazine named Wallace the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue in 2002. In 2003, when XXL magazine asked several hip hop artists to list their five favorite MCs, Wallace\'s name appeared on more rappers\' lists than anyone else. In 2006, MTV ranked him at No. 3 on their list of The Greatest MCs of All Time, calling him possibly \"the most skillful ever on the mic\". Editors of About.com ranked him No. 3 on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007). In 2012, The Source ranked him No. 3 on their list of the Top 50 Lyrical Leaders of all time. Rolling Stone has referred to him as the \"greatest rapper that ever lived\". In 2015, Billboard named Wallace as the greatest rapper of all time.\n\nSince his death, Wallace\'s lyrics have been sampled and quoted by a variety of hip hop, R&B and pop artists including Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Fat Joe, Nelly, Ja Rule, Eminem, Lil Wayne, Game, Clinton Sparks, Michael Jackson and Usher. On August 28, 2005, at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, Sean Combs (then using the rap alias \"P. Diddy\") and Snoop Dogg paid tribute to Wallace: an orchestra played while the vocals from \"Juicy\" and \"Warning\" played on the arena speakers. In September 2005, VH1 held its second annual \"Hip Hop Honors\", with a tribute to Wallace headlining the show.\n\nWallace had begun to promote a clothing line called Brooklyn Mint, which was to produce plus-sized clothing but fell dormant after he died. In 2004, his managers, Mark Pitts and Wayne Barrow, launched the clothing line, with help from Jay-Z, selling T-shirts with images of Wallace on them. A portion of the proceeds go to the Christopher Wallace Foundation and to Jay-Z\'s Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. In 2005, Voletta Wallace hired branding and licensing agency Wicked Cow Entertainment to guide the estate\'s licensing efforts. Wallace-branded products on the market include action figures, blankets, and cell phone content.\n\nThe Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation holds an annual black-tie dinner (\"B.I.G. Night Out\") to raise funds for children\'s school equipment and to honor Wallace\'s memory. For this particular event, because it is a children\'s schools\' charity, \"B.I.G.\" is also said to stand for \"Books Instead of Guns\".\n\nThere is a large portrait mural of Wallace as Mao Zedong on Fulton Street in Brooklyn a half-mile west from Wallace\'s old block. A fan petitioned to have the corner of Fulton Street and St. James Place, near Wallace\'s childhood home renamed in his honor, garnering support from local businesses and attracting more than 560 signatures.\n\nA large portrait of Wallace features prominently in the Netflix series Luke Cage, due to the fact that he served as muse for the creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\'s version of Marvel Comics character Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes.',3066135,92547031),(11,'George Benson','George Benson is a jazz guitarist born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA on 22 March 1943. He started out playing straight-ahead instrumental jazz with organist Jack McDuff. Benson got his first experience playing with his several-year stint with McDuff\'s group. In 1964, at the age of 21, Benson recorded his first album as leader, The New Boss Guitar, with Brother Jack McDuff on organ.\n\nBenson\'s next recording was It\'s Uptown with the George Benson Quartet with Lonnie Smith on organ and Ronnie Cuber on baritone sax. This album showcases Benson\'s talent in constructing swinging bebop lines at blistering tempos. Benson followed it up with \"The George Benson Cookbook,\" also with Lonnie Smith and Ronnie Cuber.\n\nOne of his major hits is the song \"This Masquerade\", which is included in the top-selling album Breezin\' . This album represents a shift to more commercially oriented music which brought Benson a wider audience but alienated some jazz fans. Other singles that have made the Billboard Hot 100 charts include \"On Broadway\" (1978), \"Love Ballad\" (1979), \"Give Me The Night\" (1980) and \"Turn Your Love Around\" (1982).\n\nBenson continues to play outstanding jazz guitar, as evidenced on recordings such as Jimmy Smith\'s Off the Top, Benson\'s own live album Par Excellence, and Tenderly, on which Benson is accompanied by McCoy Tyner on piano.\n\nFor his contribution to the recording industry, George Benson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7055 Hollywood Blvd.',1137427,13171340),(12,'Marley Marl','Marlon Williams (born September 30, 1962 in Queens, New York City), better known as Marley Marl, is an influential hip-hop producer. He was the house producer of the Juice Crew, which, in addition to Marley Marl himself, included: Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie, Roxanne Shanté, Kool G Rap, MC Shan (his cousin) and Masta Ace, and produced songs for outside artists including King Tee and LL Cool J. \n\nHe was also an important figure in the careers of Eric B. & Rakim, as he engineered & mixed their first hits, \"My Melody\" and \"Eric B Is President\". Marley Marl was one of the pioneers of sampling in hip-hop. He debuted as an electro producer, but his records became more sample-heavy, as can be seen by comparing the MC Shan LPs Down By Law (1987) and Born to be Wild (1988). The rhythms became less electronic, with drum machines becoming less prominent. Marl started his career working for Tuff City records. He debuted with his own track called \"DJ Cuttin\" in 1985, released under the pseudonym NYC Cutter. In 1994, Marley Marl was referenced on Biggie Smalls\' track \"Juicy\" as being one of his early influences.',49651,236713),(13,'The Rapsody','The correct tag for female artist is Rapsody.\n\nThe Rapsody is alias of Voelker Brothers (producers).\n\nThe Rapsody Overture: Hip Hop Meets Classic is a concept album of remixes consisting of Hip Hop and Classical genre of music which combined American rappers with European opera singers. It was released in 1997 by Mercury Records and distributed by Def Jam Recordings.\n\n\"Prince Igor\" was a #1 hit across Europe in 1998, a duet between American rapper Warren G and Sissel Kyrkjebø.

It was created by rapper Nas, his manager Steve Stoute, producer Dr. Dre and production team the Trackmasters. The group, composed of East Coast rappers Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ and Cormega, was introduced via the song \"Affirmative Action\" on Nas\' second LP \"It Was Written\". Due to a falling out between Nas and Cormega, the latter was replaced with Nature.\n\nAlthough the group received initial hype and high expectations from fans upon their formation after collectively signing to Dr. Dre\'s Aftermath label, The Firm\'s debut album, The Album (1997), generated disappointing sales and mixed reviews. The album, which featured predominant mafioso rap-themes and production from Dr. Dre and the Trackmasters, was criticized for its mainstream, pop-orientation. Their debut album was the group\'s only release and it subsequently disbanded in 1998 with each member continuing their solo careers.\n\nThe group reunited for the song \"Full Circle\" on Nas\' thirteenth album \"King\'s Disease\" in 2020.\n\n2) The Firm was an English rock supergroup comprising former Free and Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers, ex-Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, ex-Uriah Heep and Manfred Mann\'s Earth Band drummer Chris Slade and bass player Tony Franklin. Formed in 1984, the band had only mediocre album sales, although they did have sellout tours. Page and Rodgers originally wanted former Yes drummer Bill Bruford and fretless bassist Pino Palladino in the group; however, Bruford was contracted to another label and Palladino had tour commitments with singer Paul Young.\n\nBand members\n    * Paul Rodgers - lead vocals, rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar\n    * Jimmy Page - lead & rhythm guitars, acoustic guitar\n    * Tony Franklin - bass, keyboards, synthesizer\n    * Chris Slade - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\nBoth Page and Rodgers refused to play any material from their former bands and instead opted for a selection of Firm songs plus tracks from both their solo albums. The new songs were heavily infused with a soulful and more commercially-accessible sound, courtesy of Franklin\'s fretless bass guitar underpinning and understated song structure. Despite refusing to play old material, the last track from The Firm, \"Midnight Moonlight\", was originally an unreleased Led Zeppelin song entitled \"The Swan Song\". This caused some critics to believe that Page had begun to run out of ideas. In subsequent press interviews, Page had indicated that the band was never meant to last more than two albums. After the band split, Page and Rodgers returned to solo work while Chris Slade joined AC/DC and Franklin teamed up with guitarist John Sykes in Blue Murder.\n\n3) The Firm was a British group from the 1980s comprising of John O\'Connor and Grahame Lister, which specialised in novelty songs.

Among the ten songs within the album, starting with a prelude, we suggest you listen to \"Features of Love\" and \"You can\'t get out of my Heart\" to better comprehend the progressive growth of his musical personality. This album includes also the hit \"Together\", and the remake of two old hits \"I\'m not in Love\" by 10 CC and \"Lovely Day\" by Bill Withers.\n\n\"Dusty Road\" is another of Mike\'s great songs.

The two grew up in the housing projects of Queensbridge and Lefrak City (both in Queens, New York), and met each other in jail in 1992 while doing kitchen duty. \n\nIn 1996, they signed to \"Penalty Records\" in a deal with \"25 to Life\" records (Tragedy Khadafi\'s label). They were also featured as \"Unsigned Hype\" in The Source magazine. In 1997, C-N-N released their debut trend-setting album, The War Report. With exquisitely dark tracks crafted by Lord Finesse, Havoc (of Mobb Deep), Clark Kent, and a number of other acclaimed producers, The War Report became an instant classic. The unique chemistry of Noreaga\'s unorthodox lyrcal delivery combined with Capone\'s street-wise slang, established the duo as a household name within the Hardcore hip hop community.\n\nAfter Capone returned from another stint in jail in 1999 the group then released The Reunion featuring the single \"Ya\'ll Don\'t Wanna\". The album struggled to go gold, due to the lack of promotion from Tommy Boy Records, and suffered from mixed reviews. In addition, Capone was sent back to prison right before the release further hurting promotion. Soon after in 2001, Capone-N-Noreaga jumped ship to powerhouse label Def Jam. Because Tommy Boy retained the trademarks to the names \"Capone-N-Noreaga\" and \"Noreaga\", the group was forced to shorten its name to C-N-N, and Noreaga was forced to bill himself as N.O.R.E. for his solo work. They recorded a new album in 2003 called The Religion, with a lead single, \"Yes Sir\", that was issued on mixtapes and promoted by a video. The single failed to make an impact, and the album was shelved.\n\nIn early 2005, Def Jam released Capone from his contract while retaining Noreaga, leaving the group\'s status in disarray. Capone released his debut album \"Pain, Time, and Glory\", in 2005. \n\nIn 2009 the duo reunited to release Channels 10 and has since then released The War Report: Report to War.',221766,2449896),(32,'Flipmode Squad','The Flipmode Squad was the production crew and musical family, founded and fronted by rapper Busta Rhymes, which counted Rah Digga, Rampage, Lord Have Mercy, Spliff Star, and Baby Sham among its members.

The deal fell apart after some white-label promos and one official single. Mos Def struck out on his own while DCQ rounded up some family members and started Medina Green, \"Medina\" being the Asiatic name for Brooklyn and \"Green\" signifying growth. Mos Def\'s career took off while DCQ worked on Medina Green.\n\nMos Def fans first came to hear DCQ when an old Urban Thermo Dynamics track, \"My Kung Fu,\" started making the Internet rounds, often mislabeled as a Medina Green track. The group -- DCQ with family members Lord Ato, Kash Rule, and Jah Born -- made its official debut in 1998 with the 12\" Crosstown Beef, released by Rawkus. The track appeared on the 1999 compilation Soundbombing, Vol. 2 compilation, and a year later their track \"Full Court Press\" landed on the Unbound Project, Vol. 1 compilation, released by Ground Control. The group got a proper debut courtesy of their old friend when Mos Def presented their mixtape You Know the Flex, Vol. 1 in 2004.',17640,83282),(34,'Sticky Fingaz','Rapper Sticky Fingaz was the frontman of hardcore rap goup Onyx and is best known for his husky voice and brash rapping style that dragged the hip-hop sound into the mosh pit. The Brooklyn-born Kirk Jones spent much of his early life as a member of a notorious New York street gang. Jones began performing with his cousin Fredro Starr, and the pair was soon discovered by hip-hop legend Jam Master Jay. Soon after, they formed Onyx. In 1993, Onyx released their first album, Bacdafucup, which became a crossover hit thanks in large part to Sticky Fingaz\' gritty style and raspy voice. The group produced two more records before Fingaz left the group to pursue solo projects. Jones also pursued a side career as a film actor. His first solo album, Black Trash: The Autobiography of Kirk Jones, which was released in 2000, is a conceptual album that is cinematic in scope that tells the story of Kirk Jones, a down-on-his-luck ex-con who finds himself wrapped up in the street life. The record stands as an impressive debut that blends Sticky Fingaz\' two loves: film and hip-hop. Decade, released on D3 Entertainment, followed in 2003. It didn\'t fare nearly as well as the debut, but it did crack the Billboard 200. ~ Jon Azpiri, All Music Guide',50817,513887),(35,'PROVÉRBIO X','',556,7071),(36,'Thaíde','',16840,87621),(37,'Bomb the Bass','Bomb The Bass (formed 1987, in London, England) is the umbrella title for the output of British musician and DJ, Tim Simenon. The band, which has evolved its style over the years, has been classed as electronic or dance.\n\nBomb the Bass was the creation of the British musician Tim Simenon.  His first single \"Beat Dis\" from the album \"Into the Dragon\" was a number two hit in the UK and was one of the first songs to introduce the mainstream to sampling culture (along with songs by Paul Hardcastle, M/A/R/R/S and S\'Express).  The song \"Megablast\" from the album was also used in the computer game Xenon 2 Megablast.  Other hits include a cover of the Aretha Franklin track \"Say a Little Prayer\" (\"Say a Little Prayer (feat. Maureen)\") and \"Don\'t Make me Wait\".  The UK Top 10-Hit \"Winter in July\" is from their second album \"Unknown Territory\".  Their third album \"Clear\" features appearances from Sinéad O\'Connor, Jah Wobble, Benjamin Zephaniah and a rare vocal from novelist Will Self.\n\nSimenon has also gone on to become a successful producer for other artists (Depeche Mode, etc.).  He also owns an Amsterdam-based label called \"Electric Tones\" on which he released in 2001 the \"Clear Cut\" EP which is the last to date from Bomb The Bass.\n\nThe band is back for the first time in 20 years at the London Astoria\n\nwww.bombthebass.com',272372,2178112),(38,'Courtney Pine','While classified as a jazz musician, Courtney Pine melds a wide variety of influences into his music. The saxophonist and clarinetist has deftly incorporated reggae, electronica, hip-hop, funk and Eastern sounds into his boundary-defying repertoire, working alongside luminaries in each genre.\n \nPine began performing professionally as a teenager, forming the hard-bop outfit Dwarf Steps. From there he toured and recorded with reggae artists General Saint and Clint Eastwood. Pine told Down Beat that his nontraditional, eclectic approach was largely influenced by early exposure to renegade saxophonist Sonny Rollins. \"If I\'d heard Charlie Parker first, I might have felt alienated,\" he said. \"But Sonny Rollins was playing something I could understand: calypso! He was like my uncle! That sucked me into the music completely!\" With Rollins and legendary saxophonist John Coltrane as influences, Pine began participating in jazz workshops with drummer John Stevens, and soon joined the jazz ensemble of Rolling Stones\' drummer Charlie Watts. He went on to tour with pianist George Russell and drummers Elvin Jones and Art Blakey, and led his own small outfits, including the World\'s First Saxophone Posse. Pine set out to promote the work of black British jazz musicians, and formed Abibi Jazz Arts in 1986. The workshop yielded the Jazz Warriors, an all-black big band that included Pine.\n\nPine released his first album, Journey to the Urge Within, on the Antilles label in 1986, and it became one of the best-selling British jazz albums of all time. Pine remained with Antilles until 1992, recording four more albums for the label and establishing himself in critics\' eyes as a potential heir to Coltrane. Several of his albums were produced by Delfeayo Marsalis, the son of jazz pianist Ellis Marsalis (who appeared on 1989\'s Vision\'s Tale) and the younger brother of trumpeter Wynton and saxophonist Branford. Pine demonstrated his eclectic interests in his last Antilles release, Closer to Home, a reggae-infused album featuring Jamaican reggae artists and produced by dancehall legend Gussie Clark.\n\nPine continued to surprise on subsequent releases and in performance as well. He guested frequently with British soul diva Mica Paris in the early 1990s and, in addition to Closer to Home, released the African- and West Indian-influenced To the Eyes of Creation on the 4th and Broadway label in 1992. Island released Eyes of Creation, a live LP, in 1995, the same year that Pine released the more orthodox jazz album Modern Day Stories on Verve. Guests on that album included pianist Gerri Allen, singer Cassandra Wilson, guitarist Mark Whitfield, trumpeter Eddie Henderson, drummer Ronnie Burrage and, giving a hint of things to come, turntablist DJ Pogo. Pine told the Toronto Sun that the recording sessions for Modern Day Stories were decidedly atypical. \"These musicians know how mad I am and they sensed this project was gonna be different from others. I didn\'t approach it the way most people do, which is you go into the studio, you get the chart, you play and you go home,\" he said.\n\nWhile tradition-oriented critics hoped that Modern Day Stories would mark Pine\'s return to jazz roots, Pine again confounded observers with his Verve release Underground in 1997, which featured a number of accomplished American jazz artists, including pianist Cyrus Chestnut, bassist Reginald Veal, and drummer Jeff Watts, but also incorporated scratching, vocals, and drum \'n\' bass beats. This album was more true to his interests, Pine told the London Independent. \"I played so many large halls, wearing a tie, going through the jazz changes, that I just couldn\'t do any more of it. I\'d finish a show and then I\'d go back to the hotel room and play a jungle record. It was like, there must be some way of bringing that side into what I was doing.\" He added that \"the itch to play something my younger sister could hear and appreciate without having to know the history of jazz was important to me.\" Pine\'s live performances also came to be known as nontraditional events, with the musician\'s high-energy shows often requiring audience participation. A remix album, Another Story, was released on the Talkin\' Loud label in 1998.\n\nPine assembled an impressive cadre of British jazz, hip-hop and R&B musicians, including vocalists Kele Le Roc, Beverly Knight, and Eska Mtungwezi, bassist Gary Crosby, guitarist Tony Remi, and rapper MC Mello, for 2000\'s Verve release Back in the Day. \"I\'m signed to an American label and I\'ve been recording with American musicians for a long time but I\'ve been touring with a great British band and I have absolute confidence in them. So why not record them?,\" Pine remarked on Verve\'s website. \"I think this album is important because it\'s an opportunity for me to present new players to people who don\'t know my music.\" While critics may still not have known what to make of Pine\'s sound, the Queen of England was evidently impressed. Pine was named an officer of the Order of the British Empire on New Year\'s Eve in 2000.\n\nPine released Devotion on the Telarc label in 2004. He plays a wide variety of instruments and also programs loops on the album, which features a broad tableaux of styles and revisits Pine\'s interest in Eastern sounds. Included are such artists as members of Transglobal Underground and Young Disciples, as well as tabla luminary Yousuf Ali Khan. Pine told the Verve website that his mission is to redefine notions of jazz. \"It\'s not just about playing the saxophone anymore,\" he remarked. \"Critics wanted to present me as a student of Rollins and Coltrane but it goes beyond the saxophone. If somebody\'s telling you that you can\'t step outside the jazz room then that\'s wrong. I feel I come from outside the jazz room anyway. What gives me a buzz is when somebody hears my music and hears the different elements at play and says \'I didn\'t know jazz was like that.\'\"',68482,514141),(39,'SP Funk','',6977,74070),(40,'Earth','There is more than one artist with this name:\n\n1) Earth is an American musical group based in Olympia, Washington, formed in 1989 and led by the guitarist Dylan Carlson. Earth\'s music is nearly all instrumental, and can be divided into two distinct stages. Their early work is characterized by distortion, droning, minimalism, and lengthy, repetitive song structures. The band\'s later output reduces the distortion while incorporating elements of country, jazz rock, and folk. Earth is recognized as a pioneer of drone metal, with the band\'s Earth 2 being regarded as a milestone of the genre.\n\nDylan Carlson founded the band in 1989 along with Slim Moon and Greg Babior, taking the title \"Earth\" from Black Sabbath\'s original name. Carlson has remained the core of the band\'s line-up throughout its changes. Outside of the underground music world, Carlson is perhaps best known for having been a close friend of grunge icon Kurt Cobain, as well as the person who purchased the gun for Kurt before he died. Cobain sang lead vocals in the song \"Divine and Bright\", from a demo included on the re-release of the live album Sunn Amps and Smashed Guitars.\n\nEarth 2 was described as a \"milestone\" by Terrorizer\'s Dayal Patterson, which he described as \"a three-track, 75 minute deluge of feedback and distorted guitars that marked the blueprint for what Carlson at the time coined \'ambient metal\'\". The band went on hiatus after the release of Pentastar: In the Style of Demons due to Carlson\'s personal problems, including heroin addiction, rehabilitation, his connection to Kurt Cobain\'s death, and incarceration. Carlson attributed the break primarily to his heroin addiction:\n\n\"At one point, music was everything to me. Then suddenly it wasn\'t and something else was there, and that was something destructive and damaging. Heroin is part of your life - you don\'t function without it. It\'s not like, \"I need to get it to write,\" it\'s at a much more fundamental level to your existence, like, \"I need it to get out of bed.\"\n\nEarth reappeared around 2000 with a markedly different sound. Its music was still drone based, slow-paced, and lengthy, but it now included a drummer and featured strong elements of country music. Remarking on the stylistic change, Carlson was quick to point to the continuity with Earth\'s previous sound:\n\n\"In 2001 I started writing again. Originally I had thought it would be something radically different and if it had been I probably wouldn\'t have stuck with the name. I thought about doing something different at first, but no matter what I do there\'s always going to be certain elements that are the same, like the slow tempos and repetition. So for whatever reason, I can\'t help myself - it was still Earth.\"\n\nThe press release for Hex; Or Printing in the Infernal Method (2005) stated the band\'s music shows \"the influence of country guitarists/songwriters such as: Duane Eddy, Merle Haggard, Roy Buchanan and fuses it with the vibe of epic visionary composer: Ennio Morricone.\" The press release for The Bees Made Honey in the Lion\'s Skull (2008) declares \"Earth shows it\'s [sic] affinity with a nod to the best elements of the more adventurous San Francisco bands of the late 1960s and 1970s, and the more spiritually aware and exciting forms of Jazz-Rock from the same era\" The press release for Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light I describes \"inspiration from both British Folk-Rock bands the Pentangle and Fairport Convention.\n\n2) Earth was an Australian death metal band from Melbourne. They are rarely active as they don\'t play live, except on occasion as part of international tours. They were well known in the Melbourne Metal scene and played many times at Metal For The Brain (a long-running annual Australian Heavy Metal festival held in Canberra, which ended its run in 2006). They were once signed to High Voltage Records (now possibly defunct) under which they released a full-length album. Former member Terry is now in a band called Canyonaero and Rick and John are now in a band called Darkest Dawn (previously known as The Deadly).\n\n3) EARTH was a Japanese pop/R&B trio, best known for their song \"time after time\".\n\n4) Earth is a psytrance / progressive trance project by DJ Sangeet.\n\n5) Earth was the original name of heavy metal pioneer band Black Sabbath. Earth evolved out of The Polka Tulk Blues Band.  They soon adopted the title of their famous song \"Black Sabbath\" as their band name after they found that they were being confused with another local band also named Earth.\n\n6) Earth is the voice of Icelandic electronic pioneers GusGus.\n\n7)  Earth is a Czech rapper.',328975,10095676),(41,'Erick Sermon','Erick Sermon is an American rapper and producer. He also goes by the names \"E-Double\" and \"The Green Eyed Bandit\". \n\nSermon is best known as one half of the late-1980s/1990s hip-hop group EPMD. He began recording solo albums for Def Jam in 1993. \nIn 1997, he rejoined EPMD. The following year, Sermon, Keith Murray and Redman recorded a cover version of \"Rapper\'s Delight\" by The Sugarhill Gang, the first hit hip-hop record. EPMD disbanded a second time in 1998. In 2000, Sermon moved over to J Records, and released the album Music the following year. The title track (a Top 40 pop hit that also made it to #2 on the R&B music charts), featured guest vocals from late soul music legend Marvin Gaye, culled from unreleased recordings which Sermon reportedly found in a small record shop in London. React was released in 2002. \nIn 2003, J Records dropped Erick Sermon due to poor record sales. However, he still went on to establish his Def Squad imprint with Motown Records. At this time, he recorded an album, Chilltown, N.Y., which was released a year later in 2004. The album was powered by the single \"Feel It\" (which contained a sample of Reggae/R&B Singer Sean Paul), a song which became a moderate success in the United States. In an interview, he stated that he was going to step aside and try to get upcoming artists in the spotlight. \nHowever, Sermon hasn\'t stopped doing music altogether, as he has produced the song \"Goldmine\" on Busta Rhymes\' album, The Big Bang in 2006. Very soon after, Sermon recorded \"Don\'t Make No Sense\" with Def Squad.\n\nSermon joined up again for a special EPMD worldwide tour in 2006, were he was being held company by Keith Murray among others.',214834,1543257),(42,'OutKast','OutKast is an American hip-hop duo from Atlanta, Georgia, United States.  The duo is one of the most successful hip-hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards.   Over 25 million copies have been sold of Outkast\'s seven releases: six studio albums—including one double album—and a greatest hits release. \n\nThe group\'s original musical style was a mixture of Dirty South and G-Funk.  Since then funk, soul, pop, electronic music, rock, spoken word poetry, jazz, and blues have been added to the group\'s musical palette. The duo consists of Atlanta native André \"Andre 3000\" Benjamin (formerly known as Dré) and Georgia-born Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton.\n\nSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below is one of only four hip-hop albums to be certified Diamond in the U.S. for shipping over 10 million units.  Along with Outkast\'s commercial success, they have maintained an experimental approach in their music and are widely praised for their originality and artistic content.\n\nBenjamin and Patton met while attending Tri-Cities High School, a Visual and Performing Arts School. Benjamin\'s parents were divorced and he was living with his father. Meanwhile, Patton had to move with his four brothers and six sisters from Savannah to Atlanta. Benjamin and Patton eventually teamed up and were pursued by Organized Noize, a group of local producers who would later make hits for TLC. The duo initially wanted to be called \"2 Shades Deep\" or \"The Misfits\", but because those names were already taken they later decided to use \"OutKast\" based on finding \"outcast\" as synonym for \"misfit\" in a dictionary.  OutKast, Organized Noize, and schoolmates Goodie Mob formed the nucleus of the Dungeon Family organization.\n\nOutKast signed to LaFace Records in 1992, becoming the label\'s first hip hop act and making their first appearance on the remix of label mate TLC\'s \"What About Your Friends\".  In 1993, they released their first single, \"Player\'s Ball\".  The song\'s funky style, much of it accomplished with live instrumentation, was a hit with audiences.  \"Player\'s Ball\" hit number-one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart.\n\nTheir debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, was issued on April 26th, 1994.  This initial effort is credited with laying the foundation for southern hip hop and is considered a classic by many hip hop aficionados.  Every track on Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was produced by Organized Noize and featured other members of the Dungeon Family.  Follow-up singles included the title track and \"Git Up Git Out\", a politically charged collaboration with Goodie Mob that was later sampled by Macy Gray for her 1999 hit \"Do Something.\"  On this early material, both André and Big Boi contrast lyrical content reflecting the lifestyles of pimps and gangsters with politically conscious material commenting on the status of African Americans in the South. OutKast won Best New Rap Group at the Source Awards in 1995.  In the same year, the group contributed \"Benz or a Beamer\" to the popular New Jersey Drive soundtrack.\n\nATLiens was OutKast\'s second album, released on August 27th, 1996.  The album exhibited more self-consciousness, and further solidified OutKast as the flagship representatives of the 1st generation Dungeon Family and the Southern hip hop movement.  The album helped the group earn more recognition among East Coast hip hop fans in the East and West coasts.\n\nFor this album, OutKast joined with partner David \"Mr. DJ\" Sheats to form the Earthtone III production company, which allowed the group to produce some of their own tracks.  \"ATLiens\" was the group\'s second Top 40 single (following \"Player\'s Ball\" from their first album), and reflected the beginning of André\'s increasingly sober lifestyle:  \"No drugs or alcohol/so I can get the signal clear,\" he rhymes about himself. \"Elevators (Me & You),\" OutKast\'s first self-produced single, became the group\'s first Top 20 hit the same year.\n\nOutKast\'s third album Aquemini was released on September 29, 1998 and also reached the number-two position on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States; its title was a combination of the zodiac signs of Big Boi (an Aquarius) and André (a Gemini).  The album was widely praised as possibly the group\'s best material to date: when reviewed by popular hip-hop publication The Source, it received the much-coveted \"5 Mics\" (out of five) rating.\n\nProducing more material themselves, both Big Boi and André explored more eclectic subject matter, delving into sounds inspired by soul, trip hop, and electro music.  The album featured production by Organized Noize and collaborations with Raekwon, funk pioneer and musical forebear George Clinton, and Goodie Mob.\n\nIn 1999, OutKast and LaFace Records were sued by Rosa Parks over the album\'s most successful radio single, which bore Parks\' name as its title. The lawsuit alleged that the song misappropriated Parks\' name, and also objected to some of the song\'s obscene language.\n\nThe song\'s lyrics were largely unrelated to Parks, save for a line in the chorus: \"Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus\".  The song, which OutKast maintained was intended partly as homage, only refers to Parks as a metaphor: the purpose of the song\'s chorus is to imply that OutKast is overturning hip hop\'s old order, that people should make way for a new style and sound.  The initial lawsuit was dismissed. Parks\' representation hired lawyer Johnnie Cochran to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied on First Amendment grounds.  In 2003, the Supreme Court allowed Parks\' lawyers to proceed with the lawsuit.\n\nIn 2004, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyers were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest.  Later that same year, the members of OutKast were dropped as co-defendants, and Parks\' lawyers continued to seek action against LaFace and parent company BMG. In 2003 André told UK journalist Angus Batey that, following a Detroit concert in the midst of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case was less to do with Rosa than with the lawyers.  The suit was finally settled on April 14, 2005, with neither OutKast nor their label having to admit any wrongdoing. The group did, however, have to agree to perform some sort of tribute to Parks.\n\nOriginally titled \"Sandbox\", the pair\'s fourth album, \"Stankonia\", was released in October 2000 to excellent reviews.  It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., and would eventually be certified quadruple-platinum.  Stankonia\'s first single was \"B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)\", a high-tempo jungle-influenced record.  The second single, \"Ms. Jackson,\" combined a pop hook with lyrics about divorce and relationship breakups, particularly André\'s breakup with singer Erykah Badu; the titular \"Ms. Jackson\" character being a doppelgänger for Badu\'s mother.  It was at this time that André changed his stage name to the current \"André 3000\".\n\nThe single became their first pop hit, landing the number-one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the number-two position on the UK Singles Chart.  The album\'s final single was the Organized Noize-produced \"So Fresh, So Clean\", featuring a credited guest appearance from regular guest vocalist and Organized Noize-member Sleepy Brown and garnered a remix featuring Snoop Dogg.   All three singles\' videos had heavy MTV2 airplay, and Outkast won two 2001 Grammy Awards, one for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \"Ms. Jackson\", and another for Stankonia as Best Rap Album.\n\nDuring the recording of Stankonia, OutKast and Mr. DJ began producing tracks for the artists on their Aquemini Records imprint through Columbia, including Slimm Cutta Calhoun and Killer Mike, who made his debut on Stankonia\'s \"Snappin\' & Trappin.\"\n\nWebzine Pitchforkmedia.com named Stankonia the 4th greatest album released between 2000 and 2004 in its 2005 feature.  In 2009, B.O.B. was chosen as the number one song of the decade.\n\nIn December 2001, OutKast released a greatest hits album, Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast, which also contained three new tracks. One of these new tracks was the single \"The Whole World,\" which won a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Killer Mike also was featured on the song, gaining some exposure among areas outside of his native Atlanta. The other two new songs were called \"Funkin\' Around\" and \"Movin\' Cool (The After Party)\"\n\nThe same year OutKast participated in the only Dungeon Family group album, Even in Darkness, along with Goodie Mob, Killer Mike, Sleepy Brown, Witchdoctor, and Backbone among others, and featuring Bubba Sparxxx, Shuga Luv and Mello.  In 2002, the group and Killer Mike contributed the lead single \"Land of a Million Drums\" to the Scooby Doo soundtrack.\n\nIn September 2003, OutKast released a double album, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.  It is essentially two solo albums, one by each member, packaged as a single release under the OutKast banner; the two members also appear on each others\' discs for a few songs apiece.  Big Boi\'s Speakerboxxx is largely a funk and Dirty South blended party record; André 3000\'s The Love Below features only brief instances of hip hop, presenting instead elements found in funk, jazz, rock, electronic music, and R&B.\n\nThe album is also OutKast\'s biggest commercial success yet, having debuted on the Billboard 200 albums chart at number-one and stayed there for several weeks.  The album eventually sold over five million copies, and, as double-album sales count double for Recording Industry Association of America certification, the album was certified diamond for 10 million units shipped in December 2004. Its latest certification, in May 2006, reaches 11 million copies in shipping.\n\nThe first two singles from the album(s), which were released nearly simultaneously, were Big Boi\'s \"The Way You Move\" and André 3000\'s \"Hey Ya!\"   The video for \"Hey Ya!\" is based on The Beatles\' landmark appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The video\'s storyline has \"The Love Below\"—a fictional band with all members, through the use of special effects, played by André—performing in London.  \"Hey Ya!\" was the number one song on the very final weekend of American Top 40 with Casey Kasem.  It was also number one a week later on the very first weekend of American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest.   The singles spent ten weeks at number one on the Hot 100 singles chart, with \"Hey Ya!\" spending nineteen weeks and \"The Way You Move\" briefly taking over in February 2004.   These singles were seen as a breakthrough for the hip-hop industry, being among the first hip-hop songs to be widely played on adult contemporary radio stations.\n\nOutKast\'s next official single was not released until the summer of 2004.  \"Roses\", a track featuring both members from The Love Below half of the album, did not meet the level of success as either of its predecessors, but it became a modest-sized hit on urban radio and the American music video networks. The video for \"Roses\" is loosely based on the musical West Side Story and Grease.  It featured sparring 1950s-style gangs, one representing Speakerboxxx, and one representing The Love Below, parodying the widespread arguing among critics and fans as to which half of the album was better and that the two members were estranged.   The final singles were André 3000\'s \"Prototype\", which was paired with a science fiction-themed video about alien visitors, and Speakerboxxx\'s \"Ghettomusick,\" which featured both members of OutKast and a sample from a song by Patti LaBelle, who also makes an appearance in the video.\n\nSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below won the Grammy Award for the 2004 Album of the Year, becoming only the second rap album to ever receive the honor (the first being The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill by Lauryn Hill in 1999).  OutKast was one of the headlining acts at the show, and gave two performances: Big Boi performed \"The Way You Move\" during a medley with George Clinton & P-Funk and Robert Randolph and the Family Band, while André 3000 performed \"Hey Ya!\" as the show closed.   In February 2004, André 3000\'s performance, which featured female dancers moving wildly around a green teepee in war paint and feathered headdresses, was criticized by the Native American Cultural Center, who called for a boycott of OutKast, Arista Records, NARAS, and of CBS, the broadcaster of the awards show. CBS later apologized.\n\nBetween OutKast albums, Big Boi and André 3000 ventured into film projects.   André co-starred in John Singleton\'s action film Four Brothers and also had a part in Be Cool, while Big Boi took a featured role in the T.I. movie ATL.  Both members also began working on a joint film, Idlewild, directed by OutKast music video director Bryan Barber.   Idlewild, a Prohibition-era musical film set to a blues-influenced hip-hop soundtrack, was released on August 25, 2006 by Universal Pictures.   The Idlewild soundtrack was released August 22, 2006.   Its lead single, \"Mighty \'O\'\", features both OutKast members, and was briefly played exclusively on local Atlanta radio stations before being issued as a single in May 2006. They released and shot the video for \"Morris Brown\" instead.   A video for \"Idlewild Blue (Don\'tchu Worry About Me)\" soon followed.\n\nAquemini Records folded in 2004, and Big Boi founded a new record label, Purple Ribbon Entertainment, to be distributed by Virgin Records.   Among its first signees were Sleepy Brown, Bubba Sparxxx, and Killer Mike, Big Boi has released a group album/compilation, titled Big Boi Presents... The Purple Ribbon All-Stars - Got Purp? Vol. 2.\n\nOne album remains on the band\'s LaFace contract.   It was originally planned as a ten-track release called 10 The Hard Way; shortly after Idlewild was released, the duo confirmed the album is still in the works, though both have begun new projects without releasing any new information on the album.   Due to both Big Boi and André\'s interest in separate projects such as movies, TV (André\'s Class of 3000) and solo albums, rumors of a split have turned up frequently in the media.   André denied those rumors in a phone interview with MTV News, stating that even though they do not feel like performing on stage together, OutKast is \"still tight\".   In an August, 2006, interview with UK journalist Craig McLean, after emphasizing that they would not split, the pair looked beyond music and film careers, Big Boi suggesting he may consider running for the job of Mayor of Atlanta in the future.\n\nIn 2007, Andre 3000 confirmed a new OutKast album would be released, but said that he and Big Boi released solo records first, stating the group album is still possibly two years away.  Big Boi\'s solo album will be released first in June/July of 2009, with the first single, \"Royal Flush\" (also featuring Andre 3000, essentially making it an OutKast song), planned to have been released on December 31, 2007, but was not released on the announced date.   Big Boi announced on his MySpace that the release date for Sir Luscious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty is now sometime in the summer of 2009.\n\nOn Nov 14, 2008, the Guardian reported that OutKast will release their follow-up to Idlewild in 2009 after Big Boi and Andre 3000 release their solo albums in the same year.  As of August 2009, the albums have not yet been released.',4904309,145689855),(43,'Blu Cantrell','Blu Cantrell (born Tiffany Cobb on October 1, 1976 in Providence, Rhode Island) is an American R&B singer.

Far from it, in fact. The singer has followed a fairly tortuous path to fame, with many ups and downs in his personal life, before achieving his current success.\n\nBorn in Paris on 7 September 1964, Pierpoljak (whose real name is Pierre) grew up in Colombes in the Paris suburbs. Pierre was a difficult adolescent who got into all sorts of trouble and in the mid-70s he got involved in the punk/skinhead movement. It was around the same time that he took his first steps as a musician, playing bass with a local band called Samu 92. Pierre’s passion for punk eventually led to him moving to London in 1981 where he threw himself into the violent, aggressive sound of the \"No future\" movement. Living in a squat in Stockwell, in south-west London, Pierre gradually came to discover reggae through his Jamaican-born neighbours, listening to the likes of Desmond Dekker and Toots and the Maytals. This proved to be a big musical revelation for him.\n\nPierre eventually returned to France and got into trouble with the authorities, ending up serving time in Fleury-Mérogis prison. When he got out of jail, the young adventurer decided to take to the high seas, travelling round the Caribbean. Pierre signed up as a member of the crew of a cargo ship and spent the next few years sailing round the French West Indies and the Dominican Republic (an island he grew particularly fond of).\n\nOn his return to France, Pierre took up his old musical activities once again and began to make a name for himself on the Paris underground scene, performing under the pseudonym Brada Peter, then Peter Pan. He managed to get two of his earliest tracks onto the 1994 compilation \"Earthquake\", an album which also featured up-and-coming reggae stars such as Saï Saï and Tonton David.\n\nSuccess story\n\nBy 1991, Pierre - who, by that point, had changed his stage name to Pierpoljak - was living in the countryside with a wife and child to support. He had started writing and composing his own material in his home studio and his songs soon came to the attention of a major label, Barclay, who offered him a recording contract in 1995.\n\n1996 saw the release of Pierpoljak’s debut album, entirely recorded in the comfort of his own home. One of the songs on it, \"La Music\", ended up remixed by legendary reggae producer Clive Hunt and this boosted the success of Pierpoljak’s album, giving it a second lease of life. A few months later, a new version of the album was released as  \"En Jamaïca\", featuring a number of Jamaican DJs toasting on several tracks including \"Annie\" and \"Touriste à Babylone.\" Meanwhile, Pierpoljak threw a great deal of time and energy into the live circuit, performing a hectic round of concerts and appearing at the famous Transmusicales festival in Rennes in 1997.\n\nAfter the experience he had acquired in the studio and on the live circuit, Pierpoljak decided the time had come to fulfill one of his oldest dreams and he flew out to record a new album in Jamaica with Clive Hunt. Working in the legendary Tuff Gong studios in Kingston Town, the French reggaeman teamed up with some of the hottest names on the local music scene including drummer Leroy \"Horsemouth\" Wallace and guitarist Earl \"China\" Smith.\n\nPierpoljak’s second album, \"Kingston Karma\", released in June 1998, featured fourteen tracks with superbly-crafted lyrics. It also included an extraordinary reworking of John Lennon’s \"Instant Karma\", characterised by Pierpoljak’s signature vocal drawl. The first single release from the album, the catchy \"Je sais pas jouer\", set the tone for what was to come, proving that French reggae could finally branch out onto the musical mainstream and follow rap to the top of the charts\n\nPierpoljak set off on an extensive national tour in 1998, taking his infectious reggae sound up and down the country. He put in a number of appearances at major French music festivals during the tour and appeared at the Printemps de Bourges in April 1999.\n\nAfter his own personal breakthrough on the French music scene, Pierpoljak embarked upon a collective project in 2000, aimed at demonstrating that Gallic reggae had now emerged in a league of its own. With a helping hand from Jamaican drummer Leroy \"Horsemouth\" Wallace, Pierpoljak got a number of young up-and-coming reggae stars such as Flamengo, Asher, Dynamik and Mathieu Ruben together with a bunch of reggae veterans including Daddy Yod, Supa John, Daddy Mory (a former member of Raggasonic) and Pablo Master. And the whole crew went into the studio together to record \"+2coeur=soleil\", a personal homage to Pierpoljak’s favourite sound.\n\nPierpoljak returned to the studio almost immediately afterwards on his own account to begin work on his next solo album, \"Je fais c’que j’veux.\" Once again, he headed out to Kingston, Jamaica, to work with his old friend, Clive Hunt. But he took a very different approach from his first album, arriving in Jamaica with his songs already written this time. Musically speaking, Pierpoljak’s second album was a pure reggae affair, but in terms of the lyrics \"Je fais c’que j’veux\" drew heavily on the singer’s own personal experiences with a number of openly autobiographical songs such as  \"Né dans les rues de Paris\" (Born on the streets of Paris) and the first single release, \"Dépareillé\" (The odd one out).\n\nThis second album proved to be a huge hit, earning Pierpoljak a double gold disc in sales. But, unfortunately, the singer fell ill while he was out on the road promoting \"Je fais c’que j’veux\" and underwent a prolonged stay in hospital. At this point, Pierpoljak began seriously questioning whether he had any kind of future in the music business at all. Beset by doubts, he decided to take to the seas once again, setting sail from the Martinican capital Fort-de-France and stopping off at the Canaries and Cape Verde along the way. It was while enjoying another brief stop in Grenada (the Windward Islands) that Pierpoljak happened to hear a burst of local ragga playing on someone’s radio. The experience rekindled his musical spark and, after not picking up his guitar once in four months, the White Rasta was suddenly motivated to start singing and playing again.\n\nBack in Paris, Pierpoljak surrounded himself with positive vibes and threw himself back into songwriting with a vengeance. This proved to be a highly productive period for the singer. Finally, at the beginning of 2003, Pierpoljak headed out to the Tuff Gong studios once again to begin work on a new album.\n\nResolutely roots\n\nSeptember 2003 saw the release of Pierpoljak’s fourth album, \"Stim Turban.\" This was intended to be a resolutely authentic ‘roots’ affair with no added effects or embellishments. This time round, Pierpoljak did not work with producer Clive Hunt, but took care of everything himself (from the songwriting and the arrangements to the final mix). In the making of this fourth album, the French reggaeman worked with the ‘crème de la crème’ of Jamaican musicians, forming a band called Stim Turban - after whom this fourth album was named. Following the release of the album, \"Général PK\" embarked upon an intensive series of concerts and performed at a number of major French and international music festivals.\n\nAfter a  trip to Tahiti, Pierpoljak was invited to perform at the Reggae Donn Sa festival in Mauritius in August 2005. He returned to the Indian Ocean region in November of that year for a concert in La Réunion.\n\nIn January 2006, Pierpoljak took part in a special ‘Francophone reggae’ night organised at the Elysée-Montmartre, in Paris. On this occasion Pierpoljak shared the stage with the likes of Tonton David and the Ivorian reggae star Tiken Jah Fakoly. And he teamed up with the latter for a live version of \"Si Si\", a duet which featured on his album \"Je blesserai personne\" released in March 2006.\n\nWorking with an artistic director for the first time in his career (despite the fact that he had publicly ridiculed the profession of artistic director on his hit \"J\'sais pas jouer\"), Pierpoljak recorded a number of new songs for his new album in France with French musicians. Then he headed off to Jamaica, where he hooked up with producer Clive Hunt once again and worked in a recording studio owned by Shaggy. Pierpoljak’s new album, \"Je blesserai personne\", was much more musically diverse than his previous work and less obviously formatted Kingston reggae-style. In fact, \"Je blesserai personne\" seemed to mark a major turning-point in the French reggae singer’s career, its release coinciding with him cutting off his dreadlocks and breaking away from his Jamaican look.\n\nAnother Pierpoljak album, entitled \"Chéper\", was released later that same year and sold exclusively at the singer’s concerts and via his website. Meanwhile, Pierpoljak appeared on the reggae compilation \"Il est cinq heures, Kingston s\'éveille\" (performing  his own reggae-fied version of \"J\'ai encore rêvé d\'elle\" by the group Il était une fois). He also recorded a duet with the Japanese artist Tomuya which featured on Tomuya’s album \"Un Japonais à Paris\" (released in March 2007).\n\nJuly 2007 saw the release of \"Tuff Gong Blues\", an album distributed in Germany but not in France. In fact, the album was released in Germany not under Pierpoljak’s name, but under the pseudonym Pekah. The songs on the album (almost all of them in English) had been recorded around the time of \"Je fais c\'que j\'veux\" and were produced by Clive Hunt. The majority of them were written by Doniki (a singer who appeared on Pierpoljak’s first Jamaican album in 1997). \"Tuff Gong Blues\" featured seven duets with Jamaican artists such as Horace Andy and Anthony B as well as an interesting reworking of Dennis Brown’s reggae classic \"Money In My Pocket.\" Coinciding with the release of \"Tuff Gong Blues\" in Germany, Pierpoljak performed a concert in Berlin at the end of July',34052,410400),(46,'jhonny lexus','',1216,12940),(47,'Puppets Of Chaos','The NYC-based rap group Puppets Of Chaos.

Nel 1992 esordisce con un demo tape di otto pezzi, Furia solista, che ricorda lo stile sincopato dei Public Enemy e di Lou X in Dal basso; la traccia che colpisce ed esprime Bassi nel modo più assoluto è la prima (Come un treno in corsa) , mentre nel 1993 esce anche il suo secondo demo, Bastian contrario. Il primo vero album, Contro gli estimatori, appare invece nel 1996. È un album dal tono alquanto risentito, che mira a far crescere il genere hip hop e ed in particolare lui stesso come rapper nell\'asfittico mondo della musica italiana: brani come Meglio riconoscere e Rappresento per il fine settimana segnano i confini del territorio artistico-musicale che Bassi rivendica come suo. Nel 1997 esce The micranous ep, EP della sua crew, la Sano Business.\n\nIl secondo progetto solista vede la luce nel 1998 ed è intitolato Foto di gruppo: un lavoro più intimista del precedente, in cui è possibile apprezzare un sensibile incremento della profondità lirica dei testi: l\'artista si confronta con il tema dello scorrere del tempo e del perdurare attraverso esso dei valori fondamentali dell\'amicizia e del rispetto. Tracce quali Il tempo che è trascorso, Family and Business, nonché l\'eponima e bellissima Foto di gruppo costituiscono una riflessione allargata a diversi momenti dell\'esistenza il cui comune denominatore è rappresentato dalla musica, che tiene insieme i ricordi e permette di prendere le distanze dal reale e di analizzarlo lucidamente. Non mancano brani più leggeri e cantabili (Dal tramonto all\'alba) e altri più tradizionalmente finalizzati alla definizione del rap come genere (Conosci il mio steelo e Bionic Skillz). Al 1998 risale anche il secondo lavoro della Sano Business, Underground troopers.\n\nIl terzo album di Bassi - che nel frattempo ha consolidato il sodalizio artistico con Dj Zeta e il duo Cricca Dei Balordi noto come Sano Business - risale al 2000, ed è Classico. Bassi chiude la parentesi intimista del precedente lavoro e ritorna a toni più incisivi ed esclamativi, forte di una accresciuta consapevolezza nelle proprie capacità artistiche, derivata dall\'ottima risposta del pubblico all\'album Foto di gruppo. Il rapper spazia allora dalla analisi disincantata della vita quotidiana di È così che va alla celebrazione del proprio stile in Classico, farcendo il tutto con una metrica sempre fresca e delle liriche tanto immaginifiche quanto taglienti.\n\nNel dicembre 2001 vede la luce Rapper italiano, quarto album solista di Bassi. Il disco prosegue sulla scia del precedente lavoro, ma denota uno scarto stilistico e musicale notevole: in esso Bassi dimostra di essere fortemente maturato dal lato della padronanza del sostrato ritmico tipico del genere, sperimentando nuovi tipi di campionamenti e riscoprendo il valore musicale dello scratch (si veda \"Lo capisci o no\"). L\'accresciuta orignalità delle rime e dall\'eterogeneità degli stili, che variano dalle atmosfere vagamente gangsta di Rapper italiano (in cui Bassi esprime tutto il suo risentimento per lo stato di anonimato in cui versa l\'hip hop in Italia e l\'incomprensione che lo circonda), all\'ironia pungente di The shit dropper fino al crunck ante litteram di Per i miei gorilla, fanno intendere che Bassi Maestro è vicino alle vette del suo perfezionamento musicale.\n\nIl 2002 saluta l\'uscita del quinto album solista, BackGround, da molti considerato il capolavoro di Bassi ed una pietra miliare nella storia del rap italiano. Sempre nel 2002 Bassi ha l\'idea di creare la sua prima raccolta, Classic Gems Vol.1. In questo disco raccoglie quello che è il suo vecchio stile, ovvero quello dei suoi primi duel album, Contro gli estimatori e Foto di gruppo. Il successivo lavoro, Classe 73, esce nel 2003 e prosegue sullo stesso tenore dell\'ottimo antecedente. Tuttavia, Bassi non riesce ad attingere pienamente alle vette di BackGround.\n\nA un anno di distanza da Classe 73 segue Seven: The Street Prequel, ponte tra Classe 73 e L\'ultimo testimone. Seven è un album meno teso, a tratti disimpegnato, ma sorretto da un\'attitudine street sobria e convincente al tempo stesso. Metricamente molto valido, esso rappresenta una parentesi quasi totalmente votata alla sperimentazione di uno stile italiano che guardi con un certo interesse al gangsta East Coast, tentativo bene esemplificato da Rezpekt, cover di Lean Back della Terror Squad di Fat Joe. In questa direzione vanno letti anche i featuring contenuti nell\'album, di Mondo Marcio e Jack the Smoker, lo stile dei quali ammicca alle atmosfere cupe e rancorose della G-Unit.\n\nL\'ultimo testimone è l\'ottava fatica di Bassi. Molti hanno individuato in quest\'album una deviazione verso i territori più lucrosi della musica pop, nel tentativo magari di ritagliarsi una fetta anche piccola della torta del music-biz. Altri pensano che esso testimoni di un\'inesausta volontà di sperimentare e di rimettersi in gioco. Il 2004 è un anno in cui Bassi fatica molto, in quanto produce un album, L\'ultimo testimone, uno street album, Seven: The Street Prequel e la terza produzione della sua crew, la Sano Business, Esuberanza.\n\nNel novembre del 2005 esce l\'ennesimo lavoro solista del Bax, Hate. La nona tessera del mosaico artistico di Bassi è per molti versi un ritorno alle origini, segnato dalla riscoperta delle radici americane del genere, da sonorità più scarne e old school e dal ricordo dei propri esordi di artista. Quella che dall\'album si ricava è l\'immagine di un Bassi completamente immerso nella sua musica, diviso tra le serate nei club e le attività di solista e produttore, che hanno contribuito a renderlo prima e a consolidarlo poi come uno degli esponenti di maggior rilievo nella scena. Produttore, solista, intrattenitore: in questi termini si misura il contributo offerto da Bassi alla causa dell\'hip hop italiano.\n\nIl 9 novembre 2006 esce il decimo album solista di Bassi, precisamente uno street album, intitolato V.E.L.M. (Vivi e lascia morire), la cui traccia omonima è chiaramente ispirata, anche nel tema ricorrente, all\'omonimo film della serie di James Bond. Come tipico degli Street Album, sono presenti molti featuring, che vanno da Mc emergenti della scena italiana come Jack the Smoker e One Mic, a nomi più affermati a livello nazionale come G-Max dei Flaminio Maphia, passando per uno dei migliori produttori attualmente in circolazione, ovvero Don Joe dei Dogo Gang.\n\nNel novembre 2007 esce Sushi ep album che contiene 6 tracce di puro hip hop underground prodotto e rappato da Bassi dedicato a chi apprezza la musica indipendente senza compromessi. Per festeggiare i dieci anni della sua crew, quest\'ultima produce Crossover, nel 2007.\n\n\nNel 2008 forma un nuovo gruppo insieme a Lord Bean e Supa: The Dublinerz.

After Jason was replaced by new drummer, Mick Harris, the band changed its name to DOOM.\n\nThis line up played one or two gigs, playing in a crossover metal style. Talbot and Pickering decided this wasn\'t the direction they wanted the band to move in. Consequently they left Harris and the metal style of music, and decided to go in a Discharge-influenced crossover thrash-style that Doom became known for. Pickering dropped bass to concentrate on vocals and Pete Nash joined as bass player. Harris left for Napalm Death so new drummer Tony \'Stick\' Dickens, recently made bandless, joined after a drunken meeting at the infamous Mermaid Pub, this was when the \'real\' Doom was formed. The band started rehearsing with this line-up in mid 1987.\n\nAbout this time a small label called Peaceville Records was starting up. They heard about Doom through word of mouth and asked if they were interested in contributing songs to the first peaceville compilation A Vile Peace. Doom went to into the studio to record their first demo on 28 August 1987. Nash unfortunately broke his wrist just before Doom\'s recording debut, so bass player Jim Whitley (of Napalm Death and Ripcord fame) filled in on the recording. Three songs were recorded (two of which appeared on A Vile Peace).\n\nOn the strength of this first recording Peaceville asked Doom if they would record a full LP for them, which they agreed to do. The War is Big Business demo was recorded on 27 November 1987, which the band sold as a cassette at gigs. In February 1988, Doom went into \"Rich Bitch\" studios and recorded 21 songs for their debut album War Crimes (Inhuman Beings). All this time the band gigged constantly in the UK building up a following on the way. Another demo Domesday was also produced.\n\nAt the end of 1988, due to personal commitments Talbot announced that he would be leaving the band. He stayed long enough to record the split LP Bury the Debt - Not the Dead (with Swedish band No Security) on the Peaceville label. The Police Bastard EP (on discarded records) was also recorded at the same session. Doom were also invited to record two sessions for Radio One\'s John Peel show around this point. Talbot left the band in April 1989 after completing a lengthy European tour.\n\nDoom continued with different guitarists, most notably with Dave Talbot who co-founded UK doom metal band Solstice with Sore Throat\'s vocalist Rich Walker, but did not settle with four members for long playing numerous gigs as a three piece, as Pickering turned to vocal and guitar duties. This line up continued until a final split in August 1990. Following the group\'s demise Pickering formed Police Bastard, whilst drummer Stick joined Extreme Noise Terror then DIRT.\n\nThe band reformed in 1992 with the earlier line up of Talbot, Pickering, Nash and Stick. They toured Japan and recorded a 12\" of new songs released on the label Vinyl Japan. This proved to be the last recording with this line up. About this point the band almost split up but Talbot and Stick decided to continue with two new members. These being Tom Croft from Genital Deformities on vocals and Paul \"Mall\" Mallen on bass guitar. This line up recorded the split album with Selfish and a split 7\" EP with Hiatus. Mall left shortly afterwards (an amicable parting). He was replaced by bassist Scoot from Largactyl.\n\nThis line up recorded the split 7\" EP Doomed to Extinction with Extinction of Mankind, the Fuck Peaceville double LP, and the Hail to Sweden 7\" EP. This is also the line up who appear on the Videodoom video on MCR recorded on a European tour in 1994\n\nA tour of Scandinavia was organised for September 1995, however Scoot decided not to go due to problems at home, so he was replaced by Denis Boardman (of Blood Sucking Freaks) & permanently by Chris Gascoigne (of Suffer) after the tour. Tom Croft also left just after the tour and was replaced by Wayne Southworth (also of Blood Sucking Freaks). While on the Scandinavian tour Doom recorded the Monarchy Zoo 7\" EP at Sunlight Studios.\n\nThe band, now comprised of Stick, Talbot, Boardman, Southworth and Gascoigne, went into the studio in June 1996 and recorded a full LP for Flat Earth, Called Rush Hour of the Gods.\n\nTalbot would go on to join Khang, this band then evolving into Lazarus Blackstar. Stick is also part of the band RUIN.\n\nOn March 18, 2005 Wayne Southworth (lead singer) was found dead in his home by a friend. The cause of death was an epileptic seizure.\n\nThe band then toured England one last time without Wayne Southworth in tribute of their friend.\n\n2) Doom in 1985 They developed into a heavily experimental avantgarde rock/metal band approaching the 1990s, with broken/deliberatley quirky use of English in their lyrics also becoming a feature of the music. The classic line up consisted of Takashi \"Taka\" Fujita (vocals/guitar), Koh \"Pirarucu\" Morota (Fretless Bass) and Jyo-ichi \"Joe\" Hirokawa (drums). Doom released their first EP Go Mad Yourself! in 1985, and the debut album No More Pain followed in 1987. The group gained a significant following and signed to the Japanese label Invitation. They continued to release many more albums and even played a gig at CBGB\'s before releasing the final album Where Your Life Lies!? in 1999, and then the group later disbanded. The band remains heavily underground today, and information on the band and its members is rare, but they still enjoy a devoted fan base. They were also known for their chaotic, freak-show live performances, with the band members clad in Kiss style make up, having only a large grate as a barrier separating audience & band, and with some of their microphones utilised while dangling from the ceiling.\n\n3) Doom The music for the first two versions of the videogame DOOM created by id Software, was composed by Bobby Prince in the years 1992 and 1993. Some tracks were inspired, almost to be called covers, by famous artists such as Pantera, Slayer and Metallica. Wikipedia has an an detailed list about this. The site Doomworld has a section about the music containing comments from Bobby Prince himself.\n\n4) DOOM is the moniker MF DOOM has chosen for his album BORN LIKE THIS., which was released March 23rd, on Lex Records.\n\n5) Doom was a heavy metal project by multi-instrumentalist Elric Sullivan.

In 1997, Defari teamed with producer-emcee Evidence of Dilated Peoples and dropped two highly regarded singles, \"Bionic b/w Change & Switch\" and People\'s Choice b/w Bottom Line on ABB Records. Defari gained notoriety and built a reputation as an artist whose music transcended regional barriers. In May of 1998, Defari signed with Tommy Boy Records. In doing so, he became one of the first participants in the West Coast\'s Hiphop renaissance to in effect \"graduate\". \n\n  \nFollowing the release of his debut album, Defari co-headlined with Xzibit & Phife (A Tribe Called Quest) on The Underdawgs of Hip Hop National Tour in April & May of 1999. He wasn\'t a newcomer when it came to performing live. Prior to this, he toured the underground circuit for years and received rave review for being one of the most charismatic emcees to hit the stage. His energetic and captivating performances led him to other national & international tours. Rocking a wide range of audiences with some of the major players of the game today. The most current recent N. American tour being the Anger Management Tour where he performed with Xzibit and performed his own material to 20,000 plus crowds each night. Many agree that Defari knows how to bring it like a true seasoned veteran. \n It came to the point in 2000 that the fans were not going to be satisfied with just the 12” vinyl available from Defari. With ABB Records’ new initiative into the European markets, they released their first ABB Europe CD: Defari’s “LA Collexion” – a collection of all Defari’s vinyl only singles on ABB Records for the first time on CD. The whole pressing was sold out in France alone within 2 days!  \nAn even more heightened profile in the US came after his featuring on Dr Dre’s “Chronic 2001” album and touring the world on the “Up In Smoke Tour” with Dre & Eminem. With fans around the world screaming for Defari to face them one to one in shows – Defari turned to Nicci Cheeks Management in the UK to formalise a new base for his operations outside of the USA, but this time for Europe.   \n High Times Records signed Defari for his 2003 sophomore album “Odds & Evens” featuring all the usual Likwit family: Dilated Peoples, Tha Liks (Tash, J-Ro & E-Swift) and the Barbershop MCs. This was an automatic VIP round trip ticket to the Amsterdam Cannabis Cup in 2002 and 2003, where Defari performed to a very packed out Melkweg every year alongside groups including: Tha Liks and De La Soul. The release of his new album coupled with a fantastic video for the single “Spell My Name” gave fuel to fire for his European management. This has resulted in a 300% increase in Defari’s press, radio and TV coverage (including a special feature documentary about Defari on VIVA TV’s “Mixery Raw Deluxe” show during May 2004)… and ultimately his touring capabilities as a solo artist.',41623,395460),(57,'Son A Blunt','',22,89),(58,'Finsta Bundy','Golden era NY hip hop, a few 12inches released, most notably Don\'t Have To Stress Tomorrow b/w Feel The High pt2 through the tape kings label.\nLyrics from feel the high pt2. was sampled by Dj Premier on the sauce money joint against the grain off the soul in the hole soundtrack.',20177,96353),(59,'Down & Dirty Tribe','',35,283),(60,'legend aka kama kazi','',30,101),(61,'Arsonists','The Arsonists is an underground hip hop group formed 1993 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York. \n\nThe group formed with five members in 1993 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York with the name Bushwick Bomb Squad. The main members were Q-Unique, D-Stroy, Freestyle, Swel Boogie and  Jise One, although the number of members eventually grew to eight. Q-Unique was a member of New York City\'s well-known breakdancing crew, the Rock Steady Crew. The group released the single, \"The Session\", in 1996, which found airplay on New York radio stations and brought offers from record labels. They signed with the independent label Fondle \'Em Records and changed their name to the Arsonists. They released their debut album, As the World Burns, in 1999 on Matador Records. The group went from five members, down to three: Q-Unique, Jise One and Swel Boogie, for their follow-up album, Date of Birth (2001).

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most lyrical rappers of all time, and is known for helping to pioneer horrorcore.\n\nEmerging from Harlem, New York in the early to mid-1990s, Coleman became well known amongst underground hip-hop fans for his freestyling ability, and was eventually signed to Columbia Records, where he released his debut album, Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous in 1995 and is now considered by many fans as a classic album. On February 15, 1999, Coleman was shot nine times and killed by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in his hometown of Harlem.\n\nNoted for his use of wordplay, multiple writers at AllMusic, HipHopDX and The Source have praised Coleman for his lyrical ability, and he has also been described as \"one of the most auspicious storytellers in hip hop history.\" Regarding Coleman\'s legacy, Nas said on MTV, “He scared me to death. When I heard that on tape, I was scared to death. I said, ’Yo, it’s no way I can compete if this is what I gotta compete with.\'\n\nLamont Coleman was born in Harlem, New York City, on May 30, 1974, the third and youngest child of Gilda Terry (d. 2008) and Charles Davis. Davis left the family while Coleman was a child. His two older siblings, Donald Coleman and Leroy Phinazee (d.2002), were the children of Gilda and a man named Mr. Phinazee. Coleman received the nicknames \"Little L\" and \"\'mont \'mont\" as a child. At the age of 12, Coleman became a big hip hop fan and started freestyling with other people in his neighborhood. He founded a group known as Three the Hard Way in 1990, but it was quickly broken up due to a lack of enthusiasm amongst the members. It consisted of Coleman, Doc Reem, and Rodney. No projects were released, and after Rodney left, the group was renamed Two Hard Motherfuckers. Around this time, people started to refer to Coleman as \"Big L\". In the summer of 1990, Coleman met Lord Finesse at an autograph session in a record shop on 125th Street. After he did a freestyle, Finesse and Coleman exchanged numbers.\n\nColeman attended Julia Richman High School. While in high school, Coleman freestyle battled in his hometown; in his last interview, he stated, \"in the beginning, all I ever saw me doing was battling everybody on the street corners, rhyming in the hallways, beating on the wall, rhyming to my friends. Every now and then, a house party, grab the mic, a block party, grab the mic.\" He graduated in 1992.\n\nOn February 15, 1999, Big L was killed at 45 West 139th Street in his native Harlem after being shot nine times in the face and chest in a drive-by shooting. Gerard Woodley, one of Big L\'s childhood friends, was arrested three months later for the crime. \"It\'s a good possibility it was retaliation for something Big L\'s brother did, or Woodley believed he had done,\" said a spokesperson for the New York City Police Department. Woodley was later controversially released, and the murder case remains unsolved.\n\nBig L is buried at George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey.\n\nOn June 24, 2016 at 139th St. and Lenox Avenue, Woodley, 46, was shot in the head and later died at Harlem Hospital.\n\nColeman is often credited in helping to create the horrorcore genre of hip hop with his 1992 song \"Devil Son.\" However, not all his songs fall into this genre, for example, in the song \"Street Struck\" Coleman discusses the difficulties of growing up in the ghetto and describes the consequences of living a life of crime. Idris Goodwin of The Boston Globe wrote that \"[Big L had an] impressive command of the English language\", with his song \"Ebonics\" being the best example of this.\n\nHe was notable for using a rap style called \"compounding\". Coleman also used metaphors in his rhymes. M.F. DiBella of Allmusic stated Coleman was \"a master of the lyrical stickup undressing his competition with kinetic metaphors and a brash comedic repertoire\". On the review of The Big Picture, she adds \"the Harlem MC as a master of the punch line and a vicious storyteller with a razor blade-under-the-tongue flow.\" Trent Fitzgerald of Allmusic said \"a lyrically ferocious MC with raps deadlier than a snakebite and mannerisms cooler than the uptown pimp he claimed to be on records.',1056459,19540741),(64,'Buddha Monk','The Buddha Monk is a Shaolin brother of the Ol\' Dirty Bastard and has been a part of ODB\'s Brooklyn Zu clique since the very beginning. He grew up on the streets of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, hanging with the likes of ODB - who actually gave the Budha Monk his name. They knew each other since childhood as they grew up in the same neighborhood and kept bumping into each other at parties on Franklin Ave. Buddha Monk said on the subject, \"I would be DJ\'ing and Dirty would show up and start rhyming. Then he’d take the turntables and I’d get the mic. Since we were kids, we knew we were gonna always remain family”.\n\nOne day when ODB was in the studio, Monk gave suggestions on production and the RZA was pleased with his contribution and gave him permission to work with the Clan. He ended up singing backing vocals on CREAM aswell as appearances in several videos including Da Mystery of Chessboxin\' and Brooklyn Zoo. \n\nIn 1998, after the proverbial years of struggling in the streets and hopeful records deals gone sour, it was Buddha Monk’s time to shine. The Prophecy was finally revealed to the masses and received both fans and critical acclaim. The album was dubbed hard-hitting without being too self-conscious.\n\nOn the first single, “Gots Like Come On Thru” featuring Ol\' Dirty Bastard, Buddha applies the lessons that Dirty taught him: “not to clutter my music, to take my time and breathe, to harmonize and slurf my words” combined with Buddha\'s own ideas: “to make it swerve and have that extra funk that everybody can enjoy.” On tracks like “Warrior Chiefs” and “Eastside Story”, Buddha collaborates with other Brooklyn talents, such as Da Manchuz, who he\'s developing as his protégés.\n\nYears later, we would hear a lot more of Buddha’s Brooklyn Zu family with the release of the Zu-Chronicles series on Chambermusik Special Products. But between those times, the tragic passing of Ol’ Dirty Bastard in 2004 almost put an end to Buddha Monk’s career. Devastated by the loss of one of his closest friend and music compadre, the Crown Heights native thought about quitting the rap game altogether. After taking a hiatus, General Monk returned through the underground circuit with one goal in mind: ensure that ODB’s legacy lives on.\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, Buddha Monk has toured the world, worked with people from all over the planet, including more than 250 artists in the Brooklyn area alone and produced over 10,000 tracks. He is proud to include singing, rapping, producing, writing & recording to his repertoire.

A lot of confusion has existed over the exact members of this group. It was even suggested that Popa Wu was once a member. Early radio freestyles featuring Royal Fam featured some unknown artists. Two of which were Roc and Jahrule (not of the Murder Inc.) - both were present on the track \"Army Brickaid\" from Royal Fam\'s unofficial debut release. Timbo King has made mention that the Royal Fam consists of mainly 3 members, himself, Dark Ages & Malachi and Y-Kim the Ill Figure as the producer with featuring or introducing others, which have not been mentioned, certainly the presence of Roc and Ja Rule would support this statement.\n\nTimbo King is undoubtedly the group\'s main MC handling the majority of rhyming duties. Dreddy Kruger has also made a number of Wu-Tang album appearances. Dark Denim released a solo track early in his career called \"Doin\' Our Thang\" featuring Lord Smooth, under the name Dark Ages.\n\nEarly in their inception, an album called \"Black Castle\" was rumoured to have been recorded, and was to be jointly distributed by Capitol Records and Wu-Tang Records. The album even had a \"catalogue number\", a right which is reserved only for completed albums, EP\'s or singles. This would suggest some truth to this mystery, but as yet, only a handful of tracks from this supposed album has been released. \n\nIn early 2000, copies of a Royal Fam album, \"Yesterday, Today Iz Tomorrow\", was released in Europe and was subsequently made available worldwide, without the knowledge and consent of the group itself. Y-Kim has promised to release the album officially. \"Days, Months, Yearz\" was released but is very rare and hard to come across CD. Around 2006, Nature Sound Records geared up to release the long lost \"Black Castle\" as presented by Timbo King but the album got shelved due to unknown reasons with only promos released to DJs, promoters and so on.\n\nThe group have also gone under the name Royal Famous.\n\nMembers (Past and Present):\n\n- Benny Boom\n- Dark Denim (aka Dark Ages, Dark Knight)\n- Dreddy Kruger (aka Dutch Master)\n- Jahrule\n- Mighty Jarrett (aka Malachi, Mighty Jarrad)\n- Q-Base (aka the Royal Visar)\n- Roc\n- Stoneface (aka ShaRecka)\n- Timbo King (aka King Tymel, Timbuktu, Bo King)\n- Y-Kim the Ill Figure\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:\n\nSummin\' Gotz To Give bw/ I Declare War (1995)\nYesterday, Today, Iz Tomorrow (2000)\nYears Months Dayz (2004)\nBlack Castle (2006)',6011,48326),(70,'Nefret','Nefret is a Turkish rap group, formed in 1999 by Ceza and Dr. Fuchs.\n\nDr. Fuchs was required to fulfill his military obligation as per Turkish law and join the Turkish Armed Forces. During the time when Fuchs was away, Ceza worked on and released his own solo album. Later, Sagopa Kajmer was to use this against Ceza and accused Ceza of \"selling out\" his friend.\n\nUpon Dr. Fuchs\'s arrival from the millitary, the two decided to dissolve the group, fulfill different ambitions and go their seperate ways. Dr. Fuchs changed his name to Fuchs, and joined another rap group called \"Istanbul Attack\". He also played a lead role in a major bank advertisement on TV.\n\nThere is no information concerning Ceza and Fuchs ever coming back to reform \'Nefret\' as of today.\n\nNefret was one of the most well-known rap groups in Turkey, helping to launch one of the strongest rap communities outside of the United States.  It established a tendency to mix in African-American styles of lyricism with traditional Turkish rhythms, instrumental styles, and cultural references.  They eschew the \"gangster\" style that Western rap is unfortunately labeled as, and keep almost to themselves in a distinct Eastern style.',11648,91416),(71,'Binary Star','Binary Star is a hip-hop duo that consists of One Be Lo and Senim Silla.\n\nBinary Star is back to change the game once again.\n\nThe duo of emcees One Be Lo and Senim Silla possess a lethal chemistry greater than the sum of its parts. Trading verses effortlessly, the two can create magic on the mic ranging from intricate storytelling to battle raps.\n\nHailing from Pontiac, Michigan – Lo and Senim originally met in high school and instantly developed a close friendship. However one poor decision that could have easily derailed their career, made the bond between them stronger and more focused. An armed robbery conviction landed them both in prison for a three-year sentence and during this time Binary Star officially came into existence in 1998.\n\nUpon their release, Lo and Senim had grown more mature, focused, and immediately began recording what would evolve into Masters of the Universe and the classic song \"Reality Check\". Binary also had plenty of beats waiting from longtime friend Decompoze , who would co-produce a majority of the album.\n\nAfter initially pressing up CD, vinyl, and tape copies – the Binary Star buzz earned the group a distribution deal that would convert music listeners into loyal fans with the release of M.O.T.U. in 2000. It went on to sell over 25,000 units and showed the viability of independent hip-hop during a time when major labels had begun the commercialization of rap music.\n\nShortly after recording the M.O.T.U. album, the two parted ways claiming creative differences. One Be Lo developed his own solo career by rocking shows across the country. In 2005 his solo debut S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M. moved over 22,000 units on Fat Beats Records. Lo also kept fans happy with several releases on his own Subterraneous Records: Project: F.E.T.U.S., S.T.I.L.L.B.O.R.N., and The R.E.B.I.R.T.H.. This has set the foundation nicely for the highly anticipated B.A.B.Y.\n\nThey reunited briefly in 2002, doing a concert together at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont, but they did not record any new material. Although there has inevitably been speculation about a reformation of Binary Star, One Be Lo has stated that this is unlikely. \"I seriously doubt it\", he said, proceeding to claim, \"Artists are real, real picky and real, real closed minded. They can be real, real strongly opinionated. If there ain’t no real chemistry, it ain’t going to work.\"\n\nIn 2009, recently reuniting after a 10-year hiatus, Binary Star is back in the studio working on its long awaited follow-up to the classic debut album Masters Of The Universe (M.O.T.U.).

The LP\'s sound was close to classical 90s hip-hop such as Black Moon and Gang Starr. It featured the then-elite of Norwegian rappers; Apollo, Definite and Pen Jakke, and is reckoned a classic among Norwegian hip-hop heads.\n\nIn 2002, they followed with \"Mørketid\". The album showed development both in the beats and the rhymes, and had just one feature: North-Norwegian folk singer Terje Nilsen. It spawned two of the group\'s biggest hits; \"Pøbla\" and \"Bransjehora\".\n\nLater the same year they dropped a six-track EP called \"Påfyll\". It featured Poppa-Lars experimenting with live-instruments as well as guest spots from stars-to-be Jaa9 & Onkl P as well as veteran Mandal MC Son of Light. \"Påfyll\" became the group\'s last release for EMI.

Not long after he realized that drum&bass was a drug, and there was no way back. His dip into the abyss of broken rhythms was impetuous and irreversible. Rest of the music just became irrelevant.\n\nA bit later, the preferences became obvious - neurofunk, mainstream, technoid, and Stakka & Skynet, Dom & Roland, Ed Rush & Optical, Cause 4 Concern, Teebee, Ram Trilogy, Usual Suspects and Bad Company UK became his favorite producers and a sort of virtual tutors. Listening to their music, Pavel aimed to reach the sound which could be consistent with the sound of his idols. Years of hard work have helped Paperclip not only answer their sound, but even work out his own signature.\n\nThere was one problem after all the quality was something to be desired in his tracks. This problem got solved when Pavel began to post his tunes on music forums: people helped with their advice, and in this manner the quality of his tunes gradually improved.\n\nAt the present time, Pavel cooperates with many Russian and foreign producers, radio stations and labels.',17589,135694),(87,'Richard Johnson','',923,2298),(88,'DJ Godfather','DJ Godfather (Brian Jeffries) is a Ghettotech music producer and disc jockey from Detroit, Michigan.\n\nHe is the co-owner of the Twilight 76 Records label with sublabels like: Databass Records, Juke Trax, and D.E.T.

Known as the first rapper in Japan, Zeebra is a former member of the legendary hip-hop group キングギドラ, which also included DJ Oasis and K Dub Shine. He went on to pursue a solo career shortly after in 1997, and signed with the Future Shock record label. Having appeared in several TV commercials, instigated hip-hop television programs, and produced songs for upcoming rappers, Zeebra could be called the father of the Japanese rap scene.\n\nZeebra remains probably the most popular rapper in Japan, and is admired by both men and women. He appears not only in hip-hop magazines, but also in fashion and street culture magazines. He often features in and produces other rappers\' songs, and appears in their videos. He has also appeared as an opening act for American rappers.\n\nIn 1998 Zeebra undertook his first solo tour. This is when he started being recognized as an individual rapper for the first time, making hip-hop more familiar to Japanese listeners. In the same year he started the first hip-hop TV program in Japan, titled Beats to the Rhyme. One of Zeebra\'s songs was used in a Nike promotion video for NBA Japan games. The following year Zeebra released the single \"Mr. Dynamite\", the first hip-hop single to break into the top 50 on the Japanese pop charts. In June 2000, he released his new album Based On a True Story, which sold 250,000 copies. At the end of that year Zeebra started his first Japan tour, the first hip-hop event to sell out. In 2001 Zeebra released the single \"Never Enuff\", the theme song for a Japanese movie called Brother, directed by Takeshi Kitano and starring Claude Maki. In 2002 he temporarily rejoined King Giddra, but has been doing solo work since 2003 and has released many songs. At present, he is producing songs not only for rap artists, but also for pop stars like Namie Amuro.\n\nHip-hop is now firmly ensconced in the Japanese music scene, to the extent that it is even heard as background music. This would probably not have happened without Zeebra, who is often considered the originator of the Japanese hip-hop scene.',21351,488051),(92,'Ira Davis','',12,22),(93,'Genggong','',55,305),(94,'Tabernacle Of Praise','',6,152),(95,'Art Munson','',238,541),(96,'Various Artists','Warning!

It commonly appears on compilation albums or collaborative recordings where no single artist attribution applies. On digital platforms such as Last.fm, tracks may be listed under this designation when individual artist information is missing or incomplete in metadata, resulting in automatic grouping under the generic label.\n\nIn some cases, singles credited to Various Artists are issued for charitable purposes, particularly when performers collaborate under a collective project name. Examples include Band Aid with the song \"Do They Know It’s Christmas?\" and USA for Africa with \"We Are the World\".\n\nVarious Artists is also used as a performance alias by German musician Torsten Pröfrock, founder of the DIN label. In addition to this name, he has recorded under several other aliases, including Dynamo, Erosion, Resilent, and Traktor. He has collaborated with Robert Henke and has been a member of Monolake since 2004.\n\nThe name was also used by a short-lived punk band formed in Bristol by brothers Jonjo and Robin Key, originally from Birmingham. Other members were involved simultaneously in Art Objects, which later evolved into The Blue Aeroplanes; the Key brothers also contributed as songwriters and participants in that project.

Shang\'s humble beginnings started much the same as her peers in the powerful world of gospel music through traditional singing in the church choir. Shang’s vocal gift began in the late 1940’s with her grandmother Louvenia Carroll who was a member of the Legendary Clara Ward Singers.  Throughout the years, Shang and her family have laid a tremendous mark on the gospel world, spreading the gospel up and down the east coast.\n\nAt an early age, Shang decided to branch out into other aspects of music. This continued into her late teens and early twenties where she molded herself into a well rounded and diverse vocalist in all aspects of music. Several artists and management agencies began to notice her as a young vocalist with an excellent natural ear for music.  Before long she began receiving requests to sing background and fill in spots for various artists in the local area. She was quickly picked up by international recording artist, Nathan Heathman of Washington DC, who had been the musical director of the Great Phyllis Hyman until her untimely departure. Shang’s accomplishments can only be expressed by naming some of the great venues at which she has performed; the Legendary Blues Alley in Washington DC, DAR Constitution Hall in Washington DC, Hampton Jazz Festival in Hampton Va., Madison Square Gardens in New York, Aretha Franklin’s Birthday Celebration along with” Mr. Personality” himself  Lloyd Price. Bohemian Caverns in Washington DC, St. Lucia Festival, Sands Hotel in Atlantic City, Star Plaza in Indianapolis, Indiana, Zanzibar Blue w/ Nathan Heathman in Philadelphia, Pa., Civic Center in Florence, SC, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Potawatomi Casino in Milwaukee, and many more.\n\nAnother way to know the greatness of Shang’s talent is to mention some of the people she has worked closely with and received praise from; The Legendary Jean Carne, Phil Perry, Norman Connors, Jennifer Holiday, Meli’sa Morgan, Jerry Butler, Ben E. King, Gene Chandler, Lloyd Price, Chaka Khan, Yolanda Adams, Marcus Johnson, Al Johnson, Ollie Woodson (of the Temptations), Nancy Wilson, the Late Great Nathan Heathman, Maurice Chevalier Davis and Mike Gamble (her producers) and many, many others. \n\nShang\'s quiet strength and elegance can be heard in her words, “To be a gifted artist does not solely rely on your ability to sing, but also relies on your spirituality, your love for the music, passion, personality and always keeping God First in everything you do.”',2784,11334),(98,'Z\'África Brasil','Um dos mais importantes e representativos nomes do rap nacional, cujo currículo inclui quatro turnês internacionais, eles chegam-chegando nesse “Tem Cor Age” (ybmusic). Verdadeira carta-sonora acerca do Estado das Coisas na periferia da maior metrópole do Terceiro Mundo nesses primeiros anos 2000 (o futuro que não chegou!), o disco é, pra começo de conversa, um largo passo em relação ao álbum de estréia, “Antigamente Quilombos, Hoje Periferia” (ybmusic).\n\n   Seguindo a filosofia de que \"é preciso mudar pra que tudo continue igual\", a banca oriunda da Zona Sul de São Paulo, formada pelos microfones de Funk Buia, Gaspar e Pitchô, mais DJ Tano (tri-campeão do Hip-Hop DJ, verdadeiro “Quem É Quem” dos toca-discos por aqui) não só mantém a essência intacta, como a amplia ao apostar, nesse que é seu segundo álbum, na valorização da musicalidade. Nem é de se estranhar portanto, as participações de instrumentistas tarimbados como Fernando Catatau e Rian Batista (Cidadão Instigado), Theo Werneck, Dengue e Toca Ogan (Nação Zumbi), Simone Soul, ou cantores de renome como  Céu  e  Zeca Baleiro . Além de Fernandinho Beat Box, que sempre colaborou com o z’áfrica.\n\n   Ao contrário do CD anterior, em que predomina a urgência e a raiva de um discurso acumulado no peito durante os vários anos que separaram o início da carreira e o lançamento oficial do seu trabalho, dessa vez a métrica dos vocais vem trabalhada ao extremo, acompanhada por bases - assinadas pelo  Instituto , pelo DJ Periférico, e o próprio grupo, no melhor estilo \"tamo tudo junto e misturado\" - recheadas com sabores de ragga, blues, música eletrônica... e muita brasilidade.\n\n   Esse RG tupiniquim, que o ZB busca desde o início (num cenário pré-samba/rap, vale lembrar, quando isso era \"sacrilégio\"), se manifesta aqui em forma de cultura nordestina e samba. A primeira é uma influência salpicada ao longo do disco e sintetizada na faixa final, “Rei Do Cangaço”. Épico de seis minutos e meio capitaneado por Gaspar, conta a saga de Lampião. A segunda é representada por “O Bom Malandro”, carro-chefe-espontâneo de “Tem Cor Age”. Homenagem ao saudoso  Sabotage , a faixa é cantada por um Funk Buia pra lá de inspirado, tem até um sample da voz do próprio (extraído de “Dama Tereza”, pérola do repertório que o Maestro Do Canão gravou com Rica Amabis e Tejo Damasceno), e é a última palavra em termos de samba-rap. E tenho dito.\n\n   A arte do trabalho, assinada por Rodrigo Bueno, com imagens afro-brasileiras de beleza dura e mística, traduz bem o \"imaginário zafricaniano\", na qual predomina o engajamento ferrenho dos guerreiros da favela.

He discovered hip-hop in his early teens, favoring the kind of literate, ingenious rhymes he would later pursue with his own music. In high school Mason teamed with classmate Ed Zamudio, and their collaboration continued after Zamudio co-founded the Molemen collective (adopting the alias Panik in the process). In addition to his 1995 debut cassette, Who\'s Afraid?, Vakill appeared on a series of Molemen-helmed comps and mixes, most notably joining forces with Percee P and Rhymefest for the 1996 single Keep the Fame. Despite renown in underground circles for his terse rapping and razor wit, Vakill remained a largely unknown quantity until the 2003 release of his first full-length effort, The Darkest Cloud, which slowly built buzz in the months to follow. With his cult following blossoming, the rapper finally resurfaced in early 2006 with the acclaimed Worst Fears Confirmed.',28851,383883),(104,'MISTA SOULL','',4,19),(105,'Jakob Høgsbro','',36,185),(106,'Enyaphace','',70,165),(107,'Monica','Monica Denise Arnold (born October 24, 1980), professionally known as Monica, is an American R&B singer, songwriter, and occasional actress. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Arnold was a member of Charles Thompson and the Majestics, a traveling 12-piece gospel choir prior to signing a solo recording contract with Arista Records in 1995. \n\nIn 1991, at the age of eleven, Monica was discovered by music producer Dallas Austin at the Center Stage auditorium in Atlanta performing Whitney Houston 1986\'s Greatest Love of All. Amazed by her voice, Dallas offered her a record deal with his Arista Records-distributed label Rowdy Records and consulted rapper Queen Latifah to work as Monica\'s first manager. Shortly afterwards Dallas and then staff producers Tim & Bob entered the studio with Monica to start writing and producing her debut Miss Thang which was eventually released in July 1995 and scored number thirty-six on the U.S. Billboard 200 and number seven on the Top R&B Albums chart. It was certified triple platinum by the RIAA for more than three million store-shipped copies and produced three top ten singles, including debut single Don\'t Take It Personal (Just One of Dem Days) and Before You Walk out of My Life both of which made Monica the youngest artist ever to have two consecutive chart-topping hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot R&B Singles chart. Miss Thang subsequently won Monica a Billboard Music Award and garnered her an American Music Award nomination in the Favorite Soul/R&B New Artist category.\n\nAfter a label change to Clive Davis\'s Arista Records, Monica mainstream success was boosted, when Diane Warren-written For You I Will, from the Space Jam soundtrack, became her next top ten pop hit. The following year she was asked to team up with singer Brandy and producer Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins to record The Boy Is Mine, the first single from both of their second albums. Released in May 1998, surrounding highly publicized rumors about a real-life catfight between both singers, the duet became both the biggest hit of the summer and the biggest hit of 1998 in general in America, spending record-breaking thirteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It earned the pair a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and garnered multi-platinum sales (to date, it remains as one of the top twenty most successful American singles in history based on Billboard chart success).\n\nJermaine Dupri, David Foster and Austin consulted on the album The Boy Is Mine, which was released later that year and eventually became Monica’s biggest-selling album, becoming certified triple platinum by the RIAA for more than three million store-shipped copies. It yielded another two U.S. number-one hits with The First Night and Angel of Mine, a cover of Eternal\'s 1997 single, as well as a remake of Richard Marx\' Right Here Waiting. Rolling Stone Magazine proclaimed it as \"closer to soul\'s source... hearking back past hip-hop songbirds like Mary J. Blige and adult-contemporary sirens like Toni Braxton,\" while Allmusic called the album an \"irresistible sounding [and] immaculately crafted musical backdrop [...] as good as mainstream urban R&B gets in 1998.\"\n\nIn 2000, Monica contributed chorus vocals for I\'ve Got to Have It, a collaboration with Jermaine Dupri and rapper Nas. Released as the Big Momma\'s House theme song, the song saw minor success in the United States only. The following year, she released the Ric Wake production track Just Another Girl, recorded for the Down to Earth soundtrack, as a single.\n\nA year later, Arnold channeled much of her heavily media-discussed experiences into the production of her third studio album, All Eyez on Me, her first release on mentor Clive Davis newly-founded J Records label. \"I just wanted to give the people back something that had personal passion, instead of just, \'Oh, let\'s dance to this record\',\" she said about the issues worked into the tracks. The first single All Eyez on Me a Rodney Jerkins-produced R&B-dance track, saw minor to moderate success on the international charts but failed to enter the higher half of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. A follow-up song, Too Hood, also got a lukewarm response and as a result, the album\'s tentative release was pushed back several times. \"I don\'t think people wanted to hear a big fun record from me, after knowing all the things that I had personally experienced,\" Monica second-guessed her new material which saw both early and heavy bootlegging via internet at that time.\n\nAfter the Japan-wide release of All Eyez on Me Monica was asked to substantially reconstruct the record with a host of new producers, and as a result the singer re-entered recording studios to start work with songwriters Kanye West, Jazze Pha, Andre \"mrDEYO\" Deyo, Bam & Ryan and Dupri-replacing executive producer Missy Elliott. Finally released in June 2003, After the Storm debuted at number one on Billboard`s Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, and on top of the official Billboard 200, with sales of 186,000 copies emerging as Monica\'s first and only number-one album to date. It eventually received a gold certification, and has sold over one million copies domestically. Media reception of the CD was generally enthusiastic, with the Allmusic saying the album \"has all the assuredness and smart developments that should keep Monica\'s younger longtime followers behind her — all the while holding the ability to appeal to a wider spectrum of R&B and hip-hop fans.\" The album\'s lead single, Elliott-penned So Gone, was one of Monica\'s biggest commercial successes in years, becoming her first top ten single since 1999\'s Angel of Mine. In addition, it reached the top position of the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Tracks and Hot Dance Club Play charts. Subsequently, After the Storm spawned another three singles, with final single U Should\'ve Known Better reaching number nineteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nIn 2005, Monica appeared on the Tyler Perry\'s Diary of a Mad Black Woman soundtrack. The track was one of Monica\'s last production by Dallas Austin.\n\nReturning from yet another musical hiatus, Arnold\'s fourth studio album The Makings of Me was released in October 2006. Titled after Curtis Mayfield\'s 1970 recording The Makings of You, the album saw her particularly reuniting with producers Elliott, Dupri, and Bryan Michael Cox, all of whom had previously contributed to After the Storm (2003). The Makings of Me received a positive reception from most professional music critics, with Allmusic calling it a \"concise and mostly sweet set of songs,\" and Entertainment Weekly declaring it \"a solid addition\" to Monica\'s discography. While it debuted at number one on Billboard\'s Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, and at number eight on the official Billboard 200, it received a domestic sales total of 328,000 copies, it widely failed to revive the success of its predecessors and became the singer\'s lowest-selling effort to date. Singles such as snap-influenced Everytime Tha Beat Drop featuring Atlanta hip hop group Dem Franchize Boyz and Elliott-produced A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me) failed to reach the top forty of the regular pop charts.\n\nIn 2009, Arnold lent her voice to the ballad Trust a duet with Keyshia Cole, that peaked in the top five on Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The recording of Arnold\'s sixth studio album Still Standing was chronicled by her BET reality series of the same name. Featuring production by Stargate, Ne-Yo, and Polow da Don, it was released in March 2010 and garnered a generally positive response by critics, who perceived its sound as \"a return to the mid-\'1990s heyday\" of contemporary R&B, The album debuted atop on Billboard\'s Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, and number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 with opening week sales of 184,000 copies, becoming the singer\'s second highest-charting debut since 2003\'s After the Storm. The leading single Everything to Me scored Monica her biggest chart success since 2003\'s So Gone, reaching the top position of the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Tracks charts for seven weeks. The album was certified gold by the RIAA with domestic shipments of 500,000 copies within a single month. With it success, the album and Everything to Me was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&B Album and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, presented at the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011. In August 2010, Arnold joined Trey Songz on his Passion, Pain & Pleasure Tour, her first North American concert tour in ten years.\n\nThe New Life (Intro) Songfacts reports that New Life was Monica\'s debut release with RCA, following the disbandment of her former label, J Records in October 2011. The album was dropped on April 10, 2012 in the US. She explained the meaning of its title on Twitter: \"A good word goes a long way. Life is hard enough. Me and my followers believe in God, love, strength, family, unity and growth [...] Don\'t be afraid of new things, new people, new opportunities or new love. It just may give you a New Life.\"\n\n2.

Word of mouth quickly spread, and Elektra Records signed the band. The next year saw the release of Hey! Album, their breakthrough CD. It featured the catchy radio hit Freak of the Week. Riding the success of their hit single, Marvelous 3 toured aggressively, as well as appearing on major late night talk shows and being featured in numerous magazines. After touring, the band went about creating their third album, Ready, Sex, Go, which was released in 2000 in preparation for the \"rock epiphany of the new millennium.\" Ready, Sex, Go suffered from poor promotion, and the band realized that their record label wasn\'t willing to do them justice. A year after their third release, Marvelous 3 decided to part ways and take a break from the cut-throat music business. In 2002, lead singer Butch Walker began a solo career, releasing his first album Left of Self-Centered. In 2004 Butch released his follow up Letters.

Here\'s their story:\n\nStyly Cee :\"I\'ve been into hip-hop since about 1983, when I was 11. In 1985 I started going regularly to the legendary Saturday afternoon breaking sessions at Rock City in Nottingham, getting the true roots and foundation of hip-hop culture. I think the first 12\" I bought was Afrika Bamabaataa\'s \'Renegades of Funk\'. This was the start of a serious habit, and by the late 80s I was getting the urge to DJ and make music, buying breaks, old funk and jazz records, working hard learning to mix and scratch, doing tapes for friends, spreading the word. This led indirectly to me doing a prime time show on Heatwave Radio, Nottingham\'s longest running pirate radio station. Through various hook-ups from the radio, I ended up doing some session scratching on tracks by K.I.D. for Kold Sweat, MSD, Docta D, and Tickle (now known as Frisco). After us hooking up that time, it turned out that me and Frisco both felt the same about the way the hip-hop scene was going, (downhill slowly), and we had both wasted a lot of years doing projects we weren\'t in control of: it was time to sort something out properly. So here we are: Lost Island.\"\n\n Frisco: \"Frisco Boogie aka Mr. Fivemics first started practicing the art of hip-hop through B-boying around 1983, after joining a local crew called \'Supreme Force\'. We travelled around the country, performing and battling other crews. I started seriously MCing in about \'89-90, and this led to me releasing a 12\" with a group called \'Solerco\', which reached the semi-finals of the Sony Dance Music Championships in 1993 (!). I ended up doing another 12\" that year, \'Mr. Kinkleton\', on Total Frequency Records. During this time I also played drums in various Nottingham funk bands.\n\n Frisco on hip-hop: to me, to quote a rhyme, \'Its an artform born from the torn shreds of ghetto life.\' Its a way of expression, whether its positive or negative, everybody has something to say. But most of all its a battle: if you\'re a B-boy, its about busting a move harder than the next man, making the next man think \"I can\'t compete with that!\" or having the style to carry off the simplest move and make it look amazing. But when it comes to the mic, its about who got the lines, the punchlines to stop you dead. Its about the artistic creation of lyrics, metaphors, word play, creating pictures from a jigsaw of spoken word. And for me, the rhymes I want to design need to stand the test of time, so in centuries to come my great-grandchildren will still be saying \"Great-grandad - he had the next level skilz!\'\'\'\n\n Since dropping their first 3 EP\'s on SON, Lost Island did shows from Nottingham to London to Europe, with a prime slot at the UK Fresh 99 hip-hop extravaganza (hosted by Styly Cee) supporting Jurassic 5, and Dilated Peoples. They later played alongside Rahzel (The Roots) and The Arsonists. Styly started expanding his production ventures, doing remixes for Quakes, and later hooking up with new Son signing, Cappo, as well as providing the supafat cut-up intro on the label’s first compilation (‘Year One’). With his production skills starting to get some recognition outside his hometown, by 1999 Echoes were already flagging him as a talent to watch, with his nomination as one of the top 10 UK producers in their end of year round-up. In the meantime, Frisco was getting his groove on with the side-projects, making tunes with I.G.OFF (DJ Spinna\'s associate) and dropping freestyles on stage alongside Supernatural.. 1999 also saw their tunes being picked up on for a well-received compilation of UK hip-hop (\'Raw Materials\') and Bomb Records\' (the people behind the world famous \'Return of the DJ\' series) \'Contents Under Pressure\'.\n\n Having laid the foundation, the Notts veterans released their debut (and only) full-length, \'Forbidden Ground\' in 2000.',1031,3669),(113,'Świntuch','',1664,28801),(114,'Clinton','Clinton is a side project from the Cornershop members, Tjinder Singh and Ben Ayres.',11006,69265),(115,'Playdough','Playdough (Dallas, TX) has made a name for himself as one of the premier emcees in hip-hop today.

Deriving its name from a shortening of the word \"refugees\", the group consists of Wyclef Jean, Pras Michel, and Lauryn Hill. The group rose to prominence in the mid-1990s for their pioneering blend of reggae, R&B, funk and hip hop, which eschewed gangsta rap and made them one of the most significant alternative hip hop acts. They occasionally rapped in Haitian Creole, and were one of the first hip hop bands to incorporate live instrumentation during their performances, along with the Roots.\n\nIn 1993, the trio signed with Ruffhouse Records, an imprint of Columbia Records. Their debut album Blunted on Reality (1994), fused elements of political hip hop, jazz and neo soul. It was met with favorable reviews, and included the Salaam Remi-remixed underground hits \"Nappy Heads\" and \"Vocab\". According to The New York Times, the group\'s second studio album The Score (1996) placed them \"at the forefront of pop music\". The album peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200, and was certified 7× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It spawned the singles \"Ready or Not\", \"Fu-Gee-La\", and \"Killing Me Softly\". The latter single reached number one in over twenty countries worldwide. The Score was nominated at the Grammy Awards for Album of the Year. This marked the second time a rap album received a nomination for the award.\n\nAfterwards, the Fugees made an uncredited guest appearance on Simply Red\'s version of \"Angel\"; and released the single \"Rumble in the Jungle\" (featuring Busta Rhymes, A Tribe Called Quest & John Forté), both of which peaked within the top five on the UK Singles Chart. Their 1997 performance in Haiti marked the largest staged concert ever held in the country. They also collaborated with Bounty Killer on the single \"Hip-Hopera\", which spent several weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The Fugees later disbanded due to internal conflict, leading each of the members to pursue solo careers. Since then, they have briefly reunited for live performances and reunion tours; most recently in 2023.\n\nTogether they have won two Grammy Awards, a Brit Award for International Group, and the Medal of Honor from Haitian President René Préval. They are one of the best-selling hip hop groups of all time, and were the second biggest R&B act worldwide after Michael Jackson in the 1990s. The Fugees were ranked as one of the greatest rap groups by MTV (2007) and Billboard (2023), and landed at number 17 on the \'50 Greatest Hip-Hop Artists\' list (2003) by VH1. The Score was listed among the 500 Greatest Albums by Rolling Stone.

In 1994, the two recorded a demo as a group called the Numbskulls and were subsequently signed to a single deal with Loud Records in 1995. Unsatisfied with the attention they were receiving from Loud, they started to roam the underground L.A. music scene, selling mix tapes to whomever would buy them. They eventually helped form a record label called S.O.L. Music Works, Inc. with Frank \"Nebula\" Correa. Their breakthrough came through when the hip-hop community put their single \"Return\" in rotation, with its call to bring back hip-hop to where it used to be. The single is also included on their debut album, released in 2001, entitled The Self Science.',15544,133029),(127,'Defari','Defari\'s relationship with hiphop first began in 1982 as a DJ and later evolved into a new phase in 1987 when he began emceeing. 1995 marked Defari\'s debut on wax in the form of \"Big Up\", a song produced by E-Swift and featured on Immortal\'s Next Chapter Compilation. In 1997, Defari teamed with producer-emcee Evidence of Dilated Peoples and dropped two highly regarded singles, \"Bionic b/w Change & Switch\" and People\'s Choice b/w Bottom Line on ABB Records. Defari gained notoriety and built a reputation as an artist whose music transcended regional barriers. In May of 1998, Defari signed with Tommy Boy Records. In doing so, he became one of the first participants in the West Coast\'s Hiphop renaissance to in effect \"graduate\". \n\n  \nFollowing the release of his debut album, Defari co-headlined with Xzibit & Phife (A Tribe Called Quest) on The Underdawgs of Hip Hop National Tour in April & May of 1999. He wasn\'t a newcomer when it came to performing live. Prior to this, he toured the underground circuit for years and received rave review for being one of the most charismatic emcees to hit the stage. His energetic and captivating performances led him to other national & international tours. Rocking a wide range of audiences with some of the major players of the game today. The most current recent N. American tour being the Anger Management Tour where he performed with Xzibit and performed his own material to 20,000 plus crowds each night. Many agree that Defari knows how to bring it like a true seasoned veteran. \n It came to the point in 2000 that the fans were not going to be satisfied with just the 12” vinyl available from Defari. With ABB Records’ new initiative into the European markets, they released their first ABB Europe CD: Defari’s “LA Collexion” – a collection of all Defari’s vinyl only singles on ABB Records for the first time on CD. The whole pressing was sold out in France alone within 2 days!  \nAn even more heightened profile in the US came after his featuring on Dr Dre’s “Chronic 2001” album and touring the world on the “Up In Smoke Tour” with Dre & Eminem. With fans around the world screaming for Defari to face them one to one in shows – Defari turned to Nicci Cheeks Management in the UK to formalise a new base for his operations outside of the USA, but this time for Europe.   \n High Times Records signed Defari for his 2003 sophomore album “Odds & Evens” featuring all the usual Likwit family: Dilated Peoples, Tha Liks (Tash, J-Ro & E-Swift) and the Barbershop MCs. This was an automatic VIP round trip ticket to the Amsterdam Cannabis Cup in 2002 and 2003, where Defari performed to a very packed out Melkweg every year alongside groups including: Tha Liks and De La Soul. The release of his new album coupled with a fantastic video for the single “Spell My Name” gave fuel to fire for his European management. This has resulted in a 300% increase in Defari’s press, radio and TV coverage (including a special feature documentary about Defari on VIVA TV’s “Mixery Raw Deluxe” show during May 2004)… and ultimately his touring capabilities as a solo artist.',41623,395460),(128,'Strick','Tauren O\'lander Strickland, known professionally as Strick, is an American rapper and singer. He is signed to Young Thug’s YSL Records, 300 Entertainment, and Atlantic Records',114024,734357),(129,'The Roots','The Roots, also known as The Legendary Roots Crew, The Square Roots and The Foundation, is an influential, Grammy winning hip hop group based out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, famed for a heavily jazzy sound and live instrumentation. Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots\' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., bassist Leonard Hubbardand keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album, He produced songs such as Still D.R.E. by Dr Dre. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots\' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots\' debut album, Organix released in 1993, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots\' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group\'s first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard\'s album chart, spurred in part by MTV\'s airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clichés such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with R\'n\'B singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots\' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002\'s Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album\'s sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"Break You Off\" (featuring Musiq Soulchild) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChestnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots\' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don\'t Say Nuthin\'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner\'s Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots\' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots\' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z\'s Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots next album \'Rising Down\' was released on April 29th 2008. Features tracks with Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Saigon, and other greats.\n\nThe Make Me Songfacts reports that The Roots\' eleventh album, undun, is their first concept album. It tells the story of a man called Redford Stephens who died in 1999 at the age of 25. We hear Redford retelling his life post-mortem and attempting to deconstruct what led to his undoing. \n\nThe Roots are also the house band on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon airing first on March 2nd, 2009.',2019053,59772967),(130,'Canibus','Born Germaine Williams in 1974 in Jamaica, Canibus moved to the United States with his mother at a young age. Because his mother\'s career required constant relocation, the family moved frequently and the soon-to-be rapper found solace within himself. His rhetorical abilities blossomed later, once hip-hop became the guiding force in his life. He began rhyming and in the mid-\'90s joined a group called T.H.E.M. (The Heralds of Extreme Metaphors.)\n\nThis group consisted also of his partner Webb. Following a fallout with his partner, Canibus pursued a solo career and began infiltrating the mix-tape circuit. By 1997, he had approached the brink of the major-label rap game, guesting regularly on high-profile releases: He contributed to \"Uni-4-orm,\" an inclusion on the Rhyme & Reason soundtrack also featuring Heltah Skeltah and Rass Kass; \"Love, Peace & Nappiness,\" an inclusion on the Lost Boyz\'s Love, Peace & Nappiness also featuring Redman and A+; \"Making a Name for Ourselves,\" an inclusion on Common\'s One Day It\'ll All Make Sense; the non-album remix of Wyclef Jean\'s \"Gone Till November.\"\n\nAnd most famously, \"4, 3, 2, 1,\" an inclusion on LL Cool J\'s Phenomenon also featuring Redman, DMX, and Method Man.\n\nOf the several guest appearances, \"4, 3, 2, 1\" certainly meant the most, as it brought together many of New York\'s preeminent hardcore rappers and thus ushered Canibus into that same elite class. At the same time, however, Canibus lashed out shortly afterward with the Mike Tyson-featuring \"Second Round K.O.,\" where he rhymed, \"So I\'ma let the world know the truth, you don\'t want me to shine/You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine.\" \n\nIn fact, the entirety of the song directed barbed rhymes at LL: \"You walk around showin\' off your body cause it sells/Plus to avoid the fact that you ain\'t got skills/Mad at me \'cause I kick that sh*t real niggaz feel/While 99 percent of your fans wear high heels,\" and so on. Shortly thereafter, LL sought his revenge, releasing \"The Ripper Strikes Back\" on the Survival of the Illest soundtrack (1998) and thus channeling even more attention toward Canibus. \n\nFrom the track\'s chorus (\"Can-I-bus? Yes you can!\") to practically every line of the verses (\"You soft as a newborn baby takin\' a nap/Make my dick hard with that bitch-ass track/Where you at? smokin\' in some one-room flat/Suckin\' on Clef\'s dick hopin\' to come back\"), LL unleashed a fury of insults and threats. The media, of course, elevated the battle to grand heights, as even MTV gave the story headlines. In the aftermath of 2Pac\'s and Biggie\'s deaths, such confrontations fascinated the rap community, and Canibus certainly capitalized on his newfound publicity.\n\nAs for his debut full-length, Can-i-bus (1998), though, the response was sobering. Critics expressed little support, and sales quickly dropped as listeners also felt genuinely disappointed. Executive produced by Wyclef, the album suffered on many levels, both production-wise and rhetorically as well (critics targeting Canibus\' delivery more than his lyrics or themes). The momentum that \"Second Round K.O.\" had generated simmered almost immediately, and it didn\'t help that LL\'s \"Ripper Strikes Back\" found substantial acceptance at the time as well. \n\nIn the two years following the release of Can-i-bus, the rapper maintained an extremely low profile, much in contrast to the regular guest appearances he had made leading up to his debut. As a result, when he finally did return with his follow-up album, 2000 B.C. (2000), few noticed, it came and went generally unheard, and Canibus returned to the underground after parting ways with Universal. He continued to record albums and release them on the independent circuit (including 2002\'s Mic Club, 2003\'s Rip the Jacker, and 2005\'s Mind Control); furthermore, he retained a small base of fans as well, yet his days as the next-big-thing had clearly come and gone, as they similarly had for so many other talented rappers.',174575,2529285),(131,'O.C.','Omar Credle, (born in 1973 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American Rapper known as O.C. and is a member of the group D.I.T.C.. Omar moved to Queens when he was 11 years old, moving into a street across from Pharoahe Monch. In 1991, he made his recording debut on Organized Konfusion\'s \"Fudge Pudge\". One year later he made an appearance on the remix of MC Serch\'s \"Back to the Grill\" (which also features a very young Nasty Nas) after meeting Serch on the inaugural Source tour.  By 1994, he signed with Wild Pitch Records and made his debut album Word...Life. The album was critically acclaimed and O.C. was destined to stardom. In 1997 he signed to another label called Pay Day Records. There he made his sophmore album Jewelz which was also critically acclaimed and kept O.C. headed in the right direction. By 2000 he was a part of the underground Hip Hop group D.I.T.C. With them he contributed with the group to make their debut album D.I.T.C. One year later he had signed with JCOR records making his third album Bon Appetit which was not as critically acclaimed and was labeled as mediocre. In 2005 he made his fourth album with Grit Records, Starchild which dropped as an import. The album was cited as being an underground classic in the year 2005.

He is recognized for his collaborations with fellow Detroit rapper Eminem; the two met in 1997 and formed the hip hop duo Bad Meets Evil in 1998. The duo\'s 2011 single \"Lighters\", featuring Bruno Mars, peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and preceded the release of their debut extended play (EP) \"Hell: The Sequel\" (2011), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Both the single and the EP represent Montgomery\'s highest commercial achievements.\n\nMontgomery began his solo career with the release of his debut studio album \"Rock City\" in 2002. Originally scheduled for release in 2001, the album was delayed due to disputes with Columbia Records and ultimately released independently. He has self-released eight subsequent studio albums, receiving critical acclaim for each. His most recent album, \"The Allegory\" (2020), earned him his first Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Album in 2021.\n\nIn addition to his solo work, Montgomery formed the hip hop supergroup Slaughterhouse in 2008 with Joe Budden, Joell Ortiz, and Kxng Crooked. The group released two studio albums, \"Slaughterhouse\" (2009) and \"Welcome to: Our House\" (2012), achieving commercial success.

The group is composed of Willie “Skoob” Hines and Andre “Krazy Drayz” Weston. With their first album “Dead serious” released in 1992, the group creates a mini-revolution by using an ultra-fast rap associated with funky beats. The album was a commercial success. The following year, Das EFX released their second LP “Straight up Sewaside\", “Hold it down” in 1995, and “Generation EFX” in 1998. Their last album was \"How We Do\" which was released in 2003.  \n-----------\n Das EFX\'s wildly playful, rapid-fire stuttering -- dense with rhymes and nonsense words -- was one of the most distinctive and influential lyrical styles in early-\'90s hip-hop. While the duo completely rewrote the MC rule book, they themselves were increasingly pegged as a one-dimensional novelty the longer their career progressed, despite watching elements of their style creep into countless rappers\' bags of tricks. Krazy Drazyz (born Andre Weston; Teaneck, NJ) and Skoob (born Willie Hines) were both raised in Brooklyn, but didn\'t begin performing together until they met at Virginia State University in 1988. Removed from an active music scene, the two were free to develop their most idiosyncratic tendencies; they started making up gibberish words (anything ending in \"-iggity\" was a favorite) that added loads of extra syllables to their lines, and wove plenty of pop-cultural references into the tongue-twisting lyrical gymnastics that resulted. Das EFX caught their big break when they performed at a talent show judged by EPMD; though they didn\'t win, EPMD was impressed enough to offer them a deal, and the duo became part of the Hit Squad crew of protégés.\n\nSigning to the East West label, Das EFX began work on their debut album, commuting between Virginia and New York and mailing tapes to EPMD (then touring the country) for guidance. Upon its release in 1992, Dead Serious caused an immediate sensation, and is still considered something of a landmark in hip-hop circles. The first single, the instantly memorable signature song \"They Want EFX,\" was a Top 40 pop hit and a Top Ten R&B hit, and helped push sales of Dead Serious past the platinum mark. Wary of being pigeonholed by repeating themselves, the duo slowed down their lyrical flow and downplayed the surrealistic side of their interplay on the follow-up album, 1993\'s Straight Up Sewaside, which went gold. Around the time of 1995\'s disappointing Hold It Down, Das EFX found themselves caught in the middle of EPMD\'s ugly breakup; it led to a three-year absence from recording. By the time they returned in 1998 with Generation EFX, the group was playing more to a devoted but narrower cult audience; they have remained largely silent since.

He shot straight onto the scene with his debut Single On & On in 1993. A year later, only 14 years of age, he released his debut album, AKA The Rugged Child. Lyrically, he impressed rappers with a skill level that would make any hip-hop fan forget about his age altogether. As a native of Staten Island, NY, Shyheim even spent time living with Wu-Tang member Ghostface Killah. Shyheim released his second LP, The Lost Generation, in 1996. The acclaimed Manchild followed in 1999. \n\nDiscography:\nAKA the Rugged Child (1994)\nThe Lost Generation (1996)\nManchild (1999)\nThe Greatest Story Never Told (2004)\nDisrespectfully Speaking (2009)',109597,791246),(135,'Deadly Snakes','American Hip Hop group from 90s.\n\n\n\n\nFor the Canadian garage rock band check The Deadly Snakes.',2959,21939),(136,'Group Home','Group Home is a Hip Hop duo, consisting of members Lil\' Dap and Melachi the Nutcracker. They came to prominence as members of the Gang Starr Foundation, along with Gang Starr members DJ Premier & Guru, and MC\'s Afu Ra, Bahamadia, Big Shug and Jeru The Damaja. Lil\' Dap made his rhyming debut on Gang Starr\'s 1992 classic Daily Operation, on the song \"I\'m The Man\". Both members appeared on Gang Starr\'s critically acclaimed 1994 effort Hard to Earn, on the tracks \"Speak Ya Clout\" and \"Words From The Nutcracker\". In 1995, they dropped their debut album Livin\' Proof. The album was very well received, mainly due to DJ Premier\'s advanced production work. The duo released their sophomore album \"A Tear For The Ghetto\" in 1999.',195142,1920801),(137,'MC Lyte','MC Lyte (born Lana Michele Moorer on October 11, 1971 in Brooklyn, New York) is a female rap artist. She was the first female rapper commonly acknowledged to be as hard as the men: she loves to curse, and she\'s got that fierce working-class Brooklyn voice and no-nonsense demeanor. But she\'s also written some of the most fearlessly honest and introspective lyrics in modern music. Also, the first rapper ever to perform in Carnegie Hall and the Arsenio Hall show. A few years back she became the first rap artist to tour for the USO, performing for troops stationed in Italy, Greece, Sicily, and Sardinia -- an audience she intends to reach out to again in the near future.',193676,1122049),(138,'Masta Ace','Masta Ace (born Duval Clear) is a rapper from Brooklyn, New York. Appearing on the classic 1988 posse cut, The Symphony, he garnered notoriety as an unsung asset to the Juice Crew posse, and is therefore, widely considered one on the roster, where he released a number of well-respected albums that were nonetheless little-heard outside purist circles. The single that has earned him the most attention has been Jeep Ass Niguh (alternatively known as \"Born To Roll\", essentially a remix which uses the track from Def Jam artist Original Concept\'s \"Knowledge Me\").\n\nHis most recent (and reportedly final) solo album, A Long Hot Summer, gained considerable acclaim in 2004. He is currently in the hip hop group eMC, with Punchline, Wordsworth and Stricklin. They have a page at http://www.myspace.com/emcthegroup.\n\nIn the early stages of his career, Masta Ace was very energetic (cf. \"Jeep Ass Niguh\", where, tongue-in-cheek, he taunts police officers for their knee-jerk predisposition to harass black youth on city streets.) He also recorded material with a six-member supporting entourage, Masta Ace Incorporated. In light of his newly claimed status as a veteran, he has gravitated toward an earnest, matter-of-fact plainspokenness in the new millennium. Many of the songs that have lent newfound heft to his reputation are simple, no-nonsense rumination on feelings and facts of urban American life, including \"Soda and Soap\", \"Brooklyn Masala\" (which highlights a budding romance between Ace and a lovely but reserved Pakistani Hindu immigrant), and \"Beautiful\".\n\n1988-1994\nAce made his recording debut as Master Ace on the classic hip-hop posse-cut \"The Symphony\", along with fellow Juice Crew members Craig G, Kool G Rap, and Big Daddy Kane, released on Marley Marl\'s In Control album. In Control also featured two lesser known Ace tracks \"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize\" and \"Simon Says\". His first solo single, \"Together\" b/w \"Letter to the Better\", was released in 1989. He released his debut album, Take A Look Around, through Marl\'s Cold Chillin\' label in 1990, featuring production from Marl and DJ Mister Cee. The album featured two minor hit singles in \"Music Man\" and \"Me & The Biz\", a track in which he impersonates fellow Juice Crew member Biz Markie. During the few years between his debut and his sophomore album, Ace began having bitter feelings toward the commercial state of hip hop music, feelings which ruled the content on his second release, 1993\'s Slaughtahouse, with the loose concept of the album seeing Ace taking the fake \"gangsta emcees\" to his \"Slaughtahouse\". The album featured Ace\'s new crew, Masta Ace Incorporated, which included Eyceurokk, Lord Digga, Paula Perry and R&B vocalist Leschea. The album sold moderately well, fueled by the singles \"SlaughtaHouse\", \"Saturday Nite Live\", \"Style Wars\" and \"Jeep Ass Niguh\". \"Jeep\" featured an unlisted remix titled \"Born to Roll\", which became a smash crossover single in 1994, peaking at #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Also in \'94, Ace became a member of a temporary crew called the Crooklyn Dodgers, along with rap vet Special Ed and Black Moon\'s Buckshot, and recorded the title track for the soundtrack to Spike Lee\'s film Crooklyn. The song became Ace\'s second Hot 100 hit in 1994, peaking at #60 on the chart.\n\n1995-2000\nAce furthered his mainstream appeal in 1995, with his radio-friendly Sittin\' On Chrome album. This effort was also released with the Masta Ace Incorporated crew, now also known as The I.N.C. The album was Ace\'s most commercially successful release, breaking into the Top 20 on Billboard\'s Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. Sittin\' On Chrome included \"Born to Roll\", as well as two other Hot 100 hit singles, \"The I.N.C. Ride\" and \"Sittin\' on Chrome\". In 1996, Ace split up with the I.N.C. crew and was largely missing from the hip hop scene over the next five years, save for a number of random vinyl singles. During his vinyl days, he bounced from a number of labels, releasing his \"Cars\" single on Tape Kingz Records, his \"Yeah Yeah Yeah\" and \"NFL\" singles on the Union Label, his \"NY Confidential\" single on Replay Records, his \"Express Delivery\" single on Three Sixty Records, his \"Spread It Out/Hellbound\" single on Yosumi Records, his \"Conflict\" single on Mona Records, his \"Ghetto Like\" single on Fat Beats, his \"So Now U A MC\" single on Bad Magic Records, and his \"Brooklyn Blocks\" single on Buckshot\'s Duck Down Records.\n\n2001-present\nAce\'s \"Ghetto Like\" single led to a misunderstanding with an underground emcee named Boogieman, who released a somewhat similar single titled \"Ghetto Life\" not long before. He thought that Ace was \"biting\" his track and released a dis song toward Ace titled \"Just You Wait\". The dis led to a rap battle between the two at a Lyricist Lounge event, a battle that was won by Boogieman. Ace later claimed that he delivered his rhymes off the top of his head, while Boog was rapping previously written lyrics, a topic which he discusses on his scathing retaliation track \"Acknowledge\", aimed at Boogieman and the underground rap group the High & Mighty. \"Acknowledge\" was included on his fourth full length album, Disposable Arts, released in late 2001 through JCOR Records, six long years after his successful Sittin\' On Chrome album. Disposable Arts became one of the most acclaimed underground hip-hop releases of 2001, beloved for its pure hip hop style and clever album concept, which served as a fictional story, chronicling Ace\'s time spent at a satirical rap school named the Institute of Disposable Arts. JCOR Records folded soon after the release, leaving it out-of-print, until being re-released in 2005 on Ace\'s self-established M3 label. The album closer, \"No Regrets\", led many fans to believe that it would be Ace\'s final album, because of the line \"I don\'t know if it\'s the end, but yo, it might be\". Ace killed the rumors by returning in 2004 with his fifth album A Long Hot Summer, another highly acclaimed effort. The story concept, similar to that on his last release, served as a prelude to the story told on Disposable Arts, chronicling the \"Long Hot Summer\" that led to his character\'s incarceration at the beginning of the Disposable Arts album. Rumors once again spread about a retirement, which were again killed, when Ace announced the formation of his new rap crew named eMC, including himself, Punchline, Wordsworth and his protege Stricklin. The crew plans to release a group album sometime in 2007.\n\nOpenness to collaborations\nIn large part, the creative company Masta Ace keeps is comprised of underground performers with whom he has developed a personal rapport. He commonly acknowledges his fan base outside of the United States, which is considerably larger than within, as in the final seconds of his song \"Good Ol\' Love\". He has shown an openness to working with foreign-based producers, including Koolade of Croatia and DJ Serious of Canada. He also performed a guest rap for the British Acid jazz group Young Disciples for their debut album.\n\nIn Scandinavia, he recorded \"What Is It\" with Norwegian veteran producer Tommy Tee in 2003, for the soundtrack to the car racing game \"Midnight Club 2\", which also was featured on several European mixtapes.\n\nWithin the United States, he has worked with Jean Grae, 9th Wonder of Little Brother, DJ Spinna, DJ Premier, RJD2, Pete Rock, Domingo, Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest, and Kno of Cunninlynguists. Q-Tip enlisted him as a contributor to the original Crooklyn Dodgers track in 1992. The track spawned a follow-up in 1995, with a third projected for 2006, but neither Ace nor the other original contributors, Special Ed and the bellicose Buckshot (of Black Moon and Boot Camp Clik), were involved with them. Instead, the second Crooklyn Dodgers track was produced by DJ Premier and involved O.C., Chubb Rock and Jeru the Damaja, where the planned third installment is said to involve Mos Def, Jean Grae, and Memphis Bleek, with production courtesy of 9th Wonder.\n\nBy extending largesse to younger MCs even as he has been careful to solidify connections with the rap game\'s old guard, he has amassed a list of collaborators numbering over 60. The most notable of his collaborators have been Eminem (who has expressed ongoing admiration for his skills), Common (on the track \"Claimin\' Respect\" as part of a trio called Boulevard Connection), Guru of Gang Starr, Edo G (the third member of Boulevard Connection, from Boston), Jean Grae, Saukrates, Young Zee, Big Noyd, Cella Dwellas, King Tee, Tonedeff, Rah Digga, Strick, Das Efx, Greg Nice and the Beatnuts. He devotes several lines of the track \"No Regrets\" to express goodwill and thanksgiving to the artists he has worked with, calling these opportunities some of the most valued blessings of his career.',464451,7385348),(139,'Da Matrix','Hip Hop duo from Long Island NY. Raw Boom Bap Hip Hop.',182,518),(140,'Mobb Deep','Mobb Deep was a hip-hop duo made up of Havoc and Prodigy. Both members are natives of Queensbridge, New York; located in Long Island City. They are perhaps most famous for their landmark album, The Infamous, and the accompanying hit single, Shook Ones Pt. II.\n\n1992–1994: Early Career\n\nProdigy and Havoc met one another while attending the prestigious High School of Art & Design in Manhattan. Coming from similar backgrounds, the duo broke into the rap game in 1992. Growing up in hostile environments that included the prevalence of poverty, drugs, and gang violence, Mobb Deep attempted to express their life experiences through rapping circa 1992. Before Havoc and P were known as Mobb Deep they were a couple of teenaged rappers known as Poetical Profits. The world first heard of them via the Source\'s Unsigned Hype column and this is the demo track that was quoted in that feature. The song would later see the light of day on their debut LP Juvenile Hell.\n\n\"Flavor 4 The Non Believers\" (demo version) They released their first album, Juvenille Hell, in 1993. At a time when East Coast hip hop was dominated by the jazziness of A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul, and the Afro-centric stylings of Brand Nubian and Public Enemy, their style of music eschewed the popular conscious hip hop of the time, and reflected the harsh climate of New York City in the late-1980s and early-1990s. Because both Prodigy and Havoc were still in their teens at the time of their debut, many were surprised by the violent nature of the album. Although the album was not well-received by the public, it displayed the raw talent of the duo; the unique chemistry of Prodigy\'s lyrical delivery combined with Havoc\'s melancholy beats. Through this unique style, the duo were signed by Loud Records, and began recording their sophomore album, The Infamous, in 1995, which would establish the duo in the Hardcore hip hop community.\n\n1995–2000: Rise to Success\n\nFollowing its release, The Infamous became perhaps one of the most influential hip hop albums of the East Coast hardcore rap genre. Still at a young age, the duo powered themselves to the top of the hardcore rap scene through their straight forward narration of street life. As with their first lyrical production, Mobb Deep portrayed the struggles of living in New York City\'s Queensbridge. Their production also was noticed as the beats were often hard hitting and direct, a testament to Havoc, who produced the duos\' tracks almost exclusively throughout their careers. Furthermore, the hit single Shook Ones Pt. II, received acclaim as one of the greatest rap songs ever. Their third album, Hell On Earth was released in 1996, debuting at number six on the Billboard album chart. The album continued their portrayal of harsh street life, while further pushing them to the forefront of the hardcore rap scene, along with contemporary East Coast rappers such as Notorious B.I.G., The Wu-Tang Clan collective, Jay-Z, and fellow Queensbridge associate, Nas.\n\nIn 1999, the duo released the highly anticipated Murda Musik album. Despite extensive bootlegging (nearly thirty songs of unreleased material leaked onto the internet) and countless delays, the album debuted at number three on Billboard and quickly went platinum —further highlighted by the popular single, Quiet Storm. Shortly afterwards, Prodigy released his long awaited solo album H.N.I.C (2000), in which the rapper collaborated with other artists and producers (including The Alchemist).\n\n2001–2004: Decline\n\nSome time after the release of Murda Muzik, rapper Jay-Z, spoke out against the duo, leading to an increase in publicity. At the Hot 97 Summer Jam show of 2001, Jay-Z performed the freestyle, \"Takeover\", which he later re-recorded for the The Blueprint LP, dissing Prodigy. He also revealed photographs allegedly of Prodigy wearing a dance leotard in 1988. Mobb Deep subsequently released Infamy in 2001. The album marked a major stylistic change that saw the duo move away from the raw, minimalist, stripped-down beats of their hardcore roots, towards more commercial fare with such songs as Hey Luv. This transition fostered accusations of \"selling out\" — upsetting many long-time fans who did not wish to see them veer away from their original style. Although this stylistic adjustment opened up Mobb\'s audience to a wider variety, many critics and fans credit Prodigy\'s feud with Jay-Z with damaging Mobb Deep\'s gangster image and record sales (most evident when comparing the platinum-selling Murda Muzik to Infamy barely reaching the gold status). Not to be fazed, Prodigy noted that his lifelong bout with sickle cell anemia and his beef with Jay-Z had changed his outlook.\n\nIn 2003, the group split with Loud Records and released The Murda Mixtape which proclaimed \"Free Agents\" on the cover, addressing the group\'s split with Loud and search for a new label. Jive Records signed the duo later in the year and subsequently released Amerikaz Nightmare in 2004, which was seen by the general rap audience as a weaker release by the two - resulting in poor sales and the subsequent dropping of the duo from Jive.\n\n2005–2017\n\nIn the spring of 2005, it was announced that the duo signed with G-Unit Records. This came as a surprise to many, as 50 Cent aimed a sly diss at them on the \"Piggy Bank\" track. The duo made it known that this was not the case as Havoc stated in an interview, \"Mobb Deep isn\'t gonna change and when we first got here 50 was like, \'Listen, I want y\'all to keep doing what you been doing.\' That\'s it.\" 50 Cent has a connection to the duo, as he grew up in nearby Jamaica, Queens and also has used Havoc as a producer for several different beats. The relationship became deeper than business as the Mobb and 50 Cent got tattoos to pledge their loyalty to each other. Prodigy has the words \"G-Unit\" tattooed on his right hand and 50 has \"Mobb Deep\" tattooed on his wrist. Upon signing to G-Unit, both Prodigy and Havoc were given new Porsches, for two artists who have received very little monetary compensation in the past.\n\nThey recorded their album, titled Blood Money which was released on May 2, 2006. The album featured G-Unit members 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, and Young Buck. This marks their seventh release and has vaulted the duo into the hip-hop spotlight. As one of the most recognized names in hip-hop at the time, it was expected for G-Unit to help Mobb Deep attract a new fanbase. As Havoc stated shortly after the deal, “As an artist, you want to be able to reach the furthest audience as you can. We put in hard work on our previous albums and still hit our core fan base. The difference this time around is that more people will hear this product this time.” Despite this, many of the Mobb\'s longtime fans were skeptical as G-Unit is known for their mainstream crossover music, and feared that Mobb Deep will conform to this style. The album was released to mixed reception mainly from fans, regarding it as one of the duo\'s weakest albums.\n\nIn 2007, Prodigy was sentenced to serve three-and-a-half years in prison for illegal possession of a firearm. Originally facing a mandatory sentence of 15 years in prison, Prodigy struck a deal with the prosecution, and pleaded guilty in exchange for the shorter prison sentence. He would later be released from prison in March 2011, with Mobb Deep releasing their first official project in five years,  Black Cocaine, eight months later. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of their 1995 album The Infamous, the duo released their final album The Infamous Mobb Deep in 2014, featuring a second disc of unreleased songs and remixes from the 1994-95 sessions of The Infamous. They would also put out their overall final project, an EP called Survival of the Fittest in 2015, which featured an all new ESPN remix of the classic 1995 single as well as a few brand new songs.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, Prodigy died at the Spring Valley Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, due to complications related to his sickle-cell anemia.\n\nTechnique\n\nEarly on, Mobb Deep gained their critical acclaim for a dark, dynamic, grimey sound with haunting melodies--Havoc\'s production--that to many represented \"street\" in a way not done by many or any before. Additionally, Prodigy\'s penchant for starting off a verse with an attention-grabbing line, writing compelling rhymes based heavily on Queensbridge slang, and a rambling but clear delivery appealed to fans on the lyrical aspect.\n\nFor some time, Prodigy was the star MC of the duo, Havoc sounding less focused on the lyrical aspect and more on production. This continued until The Alchemist was brought in to do a few beats for each album, after which Havoc seemed to begin concentrating more on his verbal prowess, slowly developing his own style. After the beef with Jay-Z, Prodigy changed his style, rhyming words less and slowing down his delivery, while Havoc increasingly contributed more to the rhyme end of the duo. After being on independant labels, such as LOUD, and then a larger label JIVE, styles from the grimy, gritty styles from the QB duo changed greatly, much to the despair of the mainstream fans, never fully recovering from the Jay-Z beef, they were forced into the limelight, and after releasing the street wood effort of Infamy, never reclaiming the status of the best kept secret. Signing with G-Unit seems to have worsened their career and Blood Money, their first album released on G-Unit, only sold approximately 110,000 in its first week, coming in at #3 on the Billboard 200.',1697430,38710789),(141,'Natural Elements','Before materializing as an official group, the Natural Elements were originally conceived as a group of solo artists brought together in 1993 under the tutelage of producer Charlemagne. This initial grouping, whose members were initially signed to Fortress Records, included members Mr. Voodoo, L-Swift, KA, G-Blass, Howie Smalls and the InTimidator. By 1995, however, membership slimmed to include only Mr. Voodoo, L-Swift and the newly-added A-Butta.\n\nThe trio\'s countless appearances on the NYC freestyle and mixtape circuits culminated with a record deal on the Tommy Boy Black sublabel and the release of the single \"2 Tons\" in 1999. Although the highly-anticipated NE album was completed, problems with Tommy Boy shelved the project and the album never saw the light of day.',13013,93927),(142,'The Pharcyde','The Pharcyde (pronounced \"Far Side\") is an American alternative hip-hop group, formed in 1989, from South Central Los Angeles. The original four members of the group are Imani (Emandu Wilcox), Slimkid3 (Trevant Hardson), Bootie Brown (Romye Robinson), and Fatlip (Derrick Stewart). DJ Mark Luv was the group\'s first disc jockey (DJ), followed by producer J-Swift and then J Dilla.\n\nThe group is perhaps best known for the hit singles \"Drop\", \"Passin\' Me By\" and \"Runnin\'\'\", as well as their first album, Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde. Pharcyde continues to tour and record, both collaboratively and in solo projects—the most recent being Hardson\'s collaborative EP with the award-winning DJ Nu-Mark (of Jurassic 5) released in 2014 on Delicious Vinyl.\n\nPharcyde group members Slimkid3, Bootie Brown, and Imani met as dancers in the late 1980s and dancing was their main ambition as late as 1990. Around this time, Imani and Slimkid3 were in a group called \"As Is\" and later a group called the \"Play Brothers\", whilst Bootie Brown was a backup dancer for Fatlip (Fatlip being the last member to join the group). Bootie Brown recalls that their earlier dancing careers influenced their rapping – \"sometimes the way I rap is almost like the way I used to dance\". The group met Reggie Andrews, a local high-school music teacher who worked with the Dazz Band and Rick James, and who was a major musical influence on their debut album. The group also met producer J-Swift around this time, as he was Reggie Andrews\'s \"star pupil\" according to the book Check the Technique.\n\nThough Humboldt Beginnings is to date the last Pharcyde album, its members have since been keeping busy with various contributions and projects. A compilation of The Pharcyde was released in 2005, titled Sold My Soul: The Remix & Rarity Collection, featuring a number of remixes and rare songs. Former member Fatlip released his solo debut in 2005, titled The Loneliest Punk, and Tre Hardson\'s second full-length solo album SLIMKID3\'s Cafe was released on April 4, 2006. \n\n2012 saw the twentieth anniversary of The Pharcyde\'s debut Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde, and to mark the event Fatlip and SlimKid3 teamed up with the album\'s producers, J-Swift and L.A. Jay, as well as record label Delicious Vinyl, to play the album in its entirety at a tribute show at The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles. The performance was intended to be a one-off, but due to overwhelming success and reception, the group began touring the show \'Bizarre Ride Live\', and, along with MC K-Natural, working on original music under the moniker The Bizarre Ride. In December of that year, The Pharcyde released the Amerigo Gazaway-produced \"Still Got Love (Bizarre Tribe Megamix)\" garnering significant praise. 2015 marked the twentieth anniversary of Labcabincalifornia, resulting in a similar tour through Europe and Japan. The group continued touring Europe through 2017.',1287285,23725749),(143,'The Bad Seed','For those of you you are not familiar with him, Brooklyn MC Bad Seed has had minor success in underground Hip Hop since the 90\'s. Being a part of the O.B.S. crew with Jean Grae and Pumpkin Head is where he got his start in the late 90\'s. After disbanding he went solo and made a buzz from working with super producer Nottz dropping the smash singles \"For The kids\" and \"Uhhnnhh\" (which made it on Funk Flex\'s \"The Mixtape Vol VI\" album). The singles got him a deal with Warner Bros in which he recorded an album that got shelved and never released. \n\n\n2006 saw his debut project \"Dirty Urine\" which was a compilation of miscellanious tracks. Seed is also best friends with Mims, who he helped get out to the public eye before rising to fame with \"This Is Why I\'m Hot\". He was featured on Mims debut album \"Music Is My Savior\" along side Bun B. 2008 saw Seed dropping his official solo album \"Intelligently Ignant\" with the smash single \"Yankee Fitted\" featuring Talib Kweli & Mims produced by the late great Kleph Dollaz.',4645,21620),(144,'Craig Mack','Craig Mack (May 10, 1971 – March 12, 2018) was an American rapper who gained a considerable amount of fame on Puff Daddy\'s Bad Boy Entertainment record label in the 1990s. Although his first single was released under the name MC EZ in 1988, he is best known for his 1994 hit single Flava In Ya Ear, which was released under his real name. The star-studded posse-cut remix of the single was the breakout appearance of the label\'s most popular artist the Notorious B.I.G., as well as one of the first solo appearances by Busta Rhymes. The success of The Notorious B.I.G.\'s debut album Ready To Die overshadowed Mack\'s early success on the Bad Boy label, and without being able to bounce back with another commercially successful album, Mack hasn\'t been in the limelight since the 90s.\n\nNew life of Craig Mack - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR1IEw-a7Qw',269453,1640058),(145,'Keith Murray','Keith Murray (born September 13, 1974, Central Islip, New York) is a rapper and a member of the rap trio Def Squad, which includes fellow rappers Redman and Erick Sermon.\n\nMurray was introduced to Erick Sermon of EPMD by K-Solo. Sermon would feature Murray on his album No Pressure on the Single \"Hostile\". Murray quickly established himself as one of the most creative lyricists in the industry with his first album The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World, released in 1994 on Jive Records. The title track from this album remains Murray\'s biggest solo hit. This album was given 4 mics by The Source.\n\nMurray\'s second album Enigma was released in 1996 on Jive. It received similar ratings from critics, but it was not quite as commercially successful as the previous album. In 1998, The Def Squad covered \"Rapper\'s Delight\" by the Sugarhill Gang. They would later release their own album,El Niño (album). Murray\'s third album It\'s a Beautiful Thing was released in 1999 while he was in prison. Like the previous album, it received relatively good reviews, but it showed yet another drop in sales. Murray also appeared on the song \"Home Alone\" by R. Kelly. In 2001, Murray\'s return to the music industry was announced with a memorable verse on \"Fatty Girl.\" This song was featured on The Good Life, a compilation of songs for Fubu.\n\nWhile he was in prison, Murray began writing for his next solo album. Upon his release, he would leave Jive and sign with Def Jam. He\'s Keith Murray was released in 2003. Murray chose this title because the album represents him, but many fans saw it as an obvious attempt at crossover success because of singles like \"Candy Bar\" featuring Patti Austin. The album also featured the single \"Yeah, Yeah U Know It.\" This song has guest appearances from fellow Def Squad members Redman and Erick Sermon. Murray dedicated \"Christina\" to his sister. That same year, Murray was featured on the video game Def Jam Vendetta.\n\nIn 2004,he was featured in mantis\'s song Day By Day which was about street life and children.

Highly political, they fused left-wing, anarchist, anti-fascist views with punk vocals and the newly emerging techno sound that was called digital hardcore, which is a term Alec Empire later used in the name of his record company.\n\nAccording to Empire, \"Digital Hardcore initially meant the final questioning of everything, of the whole. The next step was a shorter one. The absolute negation, even to answer one\'s own existence with a \"No\". If \"No\" is true, then suicide can be as much as an event as pressing the buttons on your remote control.\" (MEAN Magazine, July 1999)\n\nThe group was founded as an attack on the increasingly neo-Nazi influenced German techno scene and consisted of three Berliners - Alec Empire, Hanin Elias and MC Carl Crack. ATR\'s early releases (which included songs like \"Hetzjagd Auf Nazis!\" / \"Hunt Down the Nazis!\") were surrounded by controversy in Germany due to the prevailing \"no politics on the dance floor\" attitude.\n\nAfter signing to Phonogram, a major European label, in 1993 the band received an unusually large financial advance which they duplicitously used to set up their own record label: Digital Hardcore Recordings or DHR. ATR never delivered a commercially viable demo to Phonogram.\n\nIn 1997 ATR was joined by Nic Endo, a Japanese-American noise/soundscape artist during the Beck tour.\n\nIn 1999 ATR released 60 Second Wipe Out, an album that phased out all use of sampling and brought on board New York City rappers the Arsonists. According to Magnet Magazine, \"Empire\'s guitar-playing values speed-thrash malevolence, and when paired with Endo\'s painful skronkage, the album is decidedly denser than its predecessor.\"\n\nThe group decided to effectively disband in 2000 and to not consider the band\'s future until 2003. Carl Crack died a few months later of a drug overdose. His death caused Empire some anguish and made any reformation less likely. Since the collapse of ATR the surviving members have all pursued separate and successful careers. Nic Endo and Empire have collaborated since but relations between Elias and Empire appear to remain strained despite their mutual business interests. This is because, as she states in interviews, Hanin Elias decided to set up her own record label, where she did not feel oppressed by the mostly male artists. Her record label is named Fatal Recordings.\n\nIn March 2002, ATR\'s album Future of War (1997) was banned in Germany. According to Alec Empire, Future of War was noteworthy because of its \"left-rooted critique of the \'modern\' high-tech-war, as we had seen it all some years previously during the Gulf War.\"\n\nIn July 3rd 2006, ATR released greatest hits compilation called Atari Teenage Riot (1992-2000). \n\nATR reformed in 2010 with CX Kidtronik joining the line-up for live dates and a single Activate! scheduled for release in May.',289101,6075787),(151,'Rodney Lawson','',3,19),(152,'Lew DelGatto','',26,177),(153,'Method Man','Clifford Smith Jr. (born March 2, 1971), known professionally as Method Man, is an American rapper, singer, record producer, and actor.

The album reached number four on the Billboard 200 and produced the hit single \"I\'ll Be There for You/You\'re All I Need to Get By\" featuring Mary J.

The son of jazz musician Olu Dara, he was raised in the infamous Queensbridge housing projects in Queensbridge, New York. According to the Nasty Songfacts, as a teenager rapper, Nasir  first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas. By the time he released his landmark solo debut album Illmatic in 1994, Jones was known as Nas. \n\nIllmatic was a critically acclaimed bestseller and is widely considered one of the greatest rap albums of all time. He married R&B singer Kelis in 2005, they have one son together, and she filed for divorce on the 29th of April 2009. Nas was also a part of hip hop supergroup The Firm, which released one album.\n\nIn the years following the release of Illmatic, Nas pursued a more commercial direction, which resulted in wider success but decreased artistic credibility among critics and hip-hop purists. Furthermore, Nas\' increased commercial success was accompanied by stylistic changes that fostered accusations of \"selling out\". Nevertheless, the LP Stillmatic is often credited for restoring Nas\' credibility among fans. Since the success of Stillmatic, Nas continues to maintain a high profile within the hip hop community, and has pursued a decidedly progressive and personal aesthetic. While Nas\' current artistic direction differs greatly from his most successful work, it has ensured that he remains one of the most respected and acclaimed contemporary rappers.\n\n1973–1992: Childhood and early career\n\nNas was born in Brooklyn, New York, as the elder of Olu Dara and Fannie Ann Jones\'s two children; his brother Jabari (nicknamed \"Jungle\" because he was born in the Congo) is the younger of the two. The family lived for a time in Brooklyn, before moving to Queensbridge, the largest public housing project in the United States. Olu Dara left the household in 1986, when Nas was 13, and Ann Jones raised her two boys on her own. Nas dropped out of school in the eighth grade and began selling drugs on the streets of New York. He educated himself, reading about African culture and civilization, the Qur\'an, the Bible and the Five Percent Nation. He also studied the origin of hip hop music, taping records that played on his local radio station. As a child, Nas had wanted to be an instrumentalist (at the age of three, Nas played his father\'s trumpet on the step of their Brooklyn home) and also a comic book artist. Shortly after his parents separated, Nas began to write short stories as he immersed himself deeper into hip-hop culture.\n\nBy his preteen years, he had settled on pursuing a career as a rapper, and as a teenager enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Willie \"Ill Will\" Graham as his DJ. Nas first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas. Nas and Graham soon met hip-hop producer and Flushing Queens resident Large Professor, who introduced Nas to his group, Main Source. In 1991, Nas made his on-record debut with a verse on \"Live at the BBQ\", from Main Source\'s LP Breaking Atoms. Despite the substantial buzz for Nas in the underground scene, the rapper was rejected by major labels and was not signed to a recording deal. Nas and Graham continued to work together, but their partnership was cut short when Graham was shot and killed by a gunman in Queensbridge on May 23, 1992.\n\n1992–1995: The recording and release of Illmatic\n\nIn mid-1992, Nas was approached by MC Serch of 3rd Bass, who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal with Columbia Records the same year. Nas made his solo debut on the single \"Halftime\" from Serch\'s soundtrack for the film Zebrahead. The single increased the buzz surrounding Nas and when MC Serch’s solo album is released later in the year, Nas’ standout appearance on \"Back To The Grill\" only intensified interest in his upcoming album, amid immense anticipation. Hailed as the second coming of Rakim, his rhyming skills attracted a significant amount of attention within the hip-hop community. However, many were concerned that Columbia, being a major label, would try to dilute his New York based style.\n\nIn 1994, Nas\' debut album, Illmatic was finally released. Critically acclaimed and widely regarded as one of the premier rap albums ever created, Illmatic featured lyrics that portrayed stunning visual imagery and production courtesy of several producers . The album featured production from Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip (of A Tribe Called Quest) and DJ Premier, as well as guest appearances from Nas\' friend AZ and his father Olu Dara on the song \"Life\'s a Bitch\", Illmatic was immediately hailed as a masterpiece by critics, and is still highly regarded as one of the definitive hip-hop albums of all time. Notable songs on the album included \"NY State of Mind\" (produced by Premier), \"The World Is Yours\" (produced by Pete Rock), \"One Love\" (produced by Q-Tip) and \"It Ain\'t Hard To Tell\" (produced by Large Professor and featuring a sample of \"Human Nature\" by Michael Jackson). However, due in part to extensive bootlegging, the record sales fell below expectations.\n\nFollowing Illmatic, Nas appeared on AZ\'s Doe Or Die album, and collaborated with his Queensbridge-associates, Mobb Deep, on their album, The Infamous. One notable achievement during this period was Nas\' verse on \"Verbal Intercourse\" on Raekwon\'s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. After this appearance, Nas received a Source Quotable as he had the distinction of being the only non-Wu-Tang Clan member to be featured on one of the group\'s solo albums.\n\n1996–1998: From It Was Written to The Firm\n\nColumbia began to press Nas to work towards more commercial topics like the rapper The Notorious B.I.G., who had become successful by releasing street singles that still retained pop-friendly appeal. Nas traded manager MC Serch for Steve Stoute, and began preparation for his second LP, It Was Written, consciously working towards a crossover-oriented sound. It Was Written, chiefly produced by Poke and Tone of Trackmasters Entertainment, was released during the summer of 1996. Two singles, \"If I Ruled The World (Imagine That)\" (featuring Lauryn Hill of The Fugees) and \"Street Dreams\" (a remix features R. Kelly) were instant hits. These songs were promoted by big-budget music videos directed by Hype Williams, making Nas a common name among mainstream hip-hop. Other notable tracks on the album included \"The Message\" and \"I Gave You Power,\" which tells a story from the perspective of a gun. It Was Written also featured the debut of The Firm, a supergroup consisting of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown, and Cormega. The album also introduced Nas\'s Mafioso-inspired character \"Nas Escobar\", who lived more of a Scarface/Casino-esque lifestyle. On the other hand, Illmatic, which, while having numerous references to Tony Montana and the theatrical hit featuring Al Pacino, was more about Nas\' life as a teenager in the projects, hustling and smoking marijuana.\n\nThe Firm signed to Dr. Dre\'s Aftermath Entertainment label, and began working on their debut album. Halfway through the production of the album, Cormega was fired from the group by Steve Stoute, who had unsuccessfully attempted to force Cormega to sign a deal with his management company. Cormega therefore became one of Nas\' most vocal opponents, releasing a number of underground hip-hop singles dissing Nas, Stoute, and Nature, who was Cormega\'s replacement in The Firm. The Firm\'s The Album was finally released in 1997 to mixed reviews and lackluster sales and the members of the supergroup went their separate ways.\n\nAt about this time, Nas became a spokesperson for the Willie Esco urban clothing line, but had no other connection with the clothing line. He stopped promoting Willie Esco in 2000, dissatisfied with the company\'s operations. During the same period, Nas co-wrote and starred in Hype Williams\' 1998 feature film Belly, which also featured DMX, Taral Hicks, and T-Boz of TLC among its cast.\n\n1998–2000: I Am... to Nastradamus\n\nIn 1998, Nas began work on a double album to be entitled I Am...The Autobiography, which he intended as the middle ground between the extremes of Illmatic and It Was Written. The album was completed in early 1999, and a music video was shot for its lead single, Nas Is Like, produced by DJ Premier and featuring vocal samples from \"It Ain\'t Hard to Tell\". However, much of the LP was leaked in MP3 format onto the Internet, and Nas and Stoute quickly recorded enough substitute material to constitute a single-disc release.\n\nThe second single for I Am was \"Hate Me Now,\" featuring Sean \"Puffy\" Combs (now \"Diddy\"), was used as an example by Nas\' critics for moving towards commercial themes. Hype Williams shot an allegorical video for the single, which featured Nas and Puffy being crucified in a manner similar to Jesus; After the video was completed, Combs, a Catholic, requested his crucifixion scene be edited out of the video. However, the unedited copy of the \"Hate Me Now\" video made its way to MTV, and was premiered on April 15, 1999 on TRL. A furious Combs and his bodyguards allegedly made their way into Steve Stoute\'s office and assaulted him, at one point apparently hitting Stoute over the head with a champagne bottle. Stoute pressed charges, but he and Combs settled out-of-court that June.\n\nColumbia had scheduled to release the pirated material from I Am under the title Nastradamus during the latter half of 1999, but, at the last minute, decided Nas should record an entirely new album for release. Nastradamus was therefore rushed to meet a November release date. Though critics were not kind to the album, it did result in a minor hit, the Timbaland-produced \"You Owe Me,\" featuring R&B singer Ginuwine. The only pirated track from I Am... to make it onto Nastradamus was \"Project Windows,\" featuring Ronald Isley. A number of the other bootlegged tracks later made their way onto The Lost Tapes, a collection of underground Nas songs that was released by Columbia in September 2002. The collection saw decent sales and received glowing reviews.\n\n2000–2001: The Nas vs. Jay-Z rivalry and Stillmatic\n\nThe highly publicized rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z began as a rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z\'s protege, Memphis Bleek. On his debut album Coming of Age, Bleek made a song entitled \"Memphis Bleek Is\", which was similar in concept to Nas\' single \"Nas is Like\". On the same album, Bleek recorded \"What You Think Of That\" featuring Bleek\'s mentor Jay-Z, which contains the refrain, \"I\'ma ball \'til I fall/what you think of that?\". In retaliation, \"Nastradamus\", the title track from Nas\' second 1999 album, featured a reference to \"What You Think Of That\". The lyrics state, \"You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that/You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat.\" Memphis Bleek perceived the reference on \"Nastradamus\" as a diss, and therefore dissed Nas on the lead single for his The Understanding LP, My Mind Right\".\n\nQB\'s Finest was a compilation album that featured Nas and a number of other rappers from Queensbridge, including Mobb Deep, Nature, Littles, The Bravehearts (which included Nas\' younger brother Jungle among its members), and Cormega, who had briefly reconciled with Nas. The album also featured guest appearances from Queensbridge hip-hop legends Roxanne Shante, MC Shan, and Marley Marl. Shan and Marley Marl both appeared on the lead single \"Da Bridge 2001\", which was based on Shan & Marl\'s 1986 recording \"The Bridge\". \"Da Bridge 2001\" also featured a response from Nas to Memphis Bleek, in which Nas called out most of the Roc-A-Fella Records roster, including Bleek, Damon Dash, Beanie Sigel, and Jay-Z.\n\nJay-Z responded to Nas\' songs with an onstage swipe during the 2001 Hot 97 Summer Jam concert in New York City, when he premiered his song \"Takeover.\" Initially, the song was to only be a Mobb Deep diss, only including one line about Nas near the end. Nevertheless, Nas recorded the \"Stillmatic Freestyle,\" an underground single which sampled Rakim and Eric B.\'s \"Paid in Full\" beat, and attacked Jay-Z and his Roc-A-Fella label. On his 2001 album, The Blueprint, Jay-Z rewrote \"Takeover,\" dedicating half of the song to dissing Nas, claiming that he had a \"...one hot album every ten year average\" record (referring to Illmatic) that his flow was weak, and that he had fabricated his past as a hustler.\n\nNas responded with \"Ether\", the track begins with gunshots and a repeated, slowed-down sample of Tupac rapping \"Fuck Jay-Z.\" (taken from Tupac\'s \"Fuck Friends\") In \"Ether,\" Nas accuses Jay-Z of stealing (\"biting\") lyrics from The Notorious B.I.G. and brown-nosing Nas and other rappers for fame. Ether was included on Nas\' fifth studio album, Stillmatic, released in December 2001. Stillmatic managed to be not only a critically-acclaimed comeback album, but a commercial success as well, albeit not on the level of It Was Written and I Am...; the album debutted at #7 on the Billboard album charts and featured the singles \"Got Ur Self A...\" and \"One Mic.\" In terms of commercial success, Jay\'s The Blueprint was certified double-platinum, while Stillmatic went platinum.\n\nJay-Z responded to \"Ether\" with a freestyle entitled \"Supa Ugly.\" going into detail about how he had sex with Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas\' daughter Destiny. Nas dismissed the track by claiming that he was no longer with Bryan during the time the affair took place. In a recent interview, however, New York radio station Hot 97 settled the battle taking votes comparing \"Ether\" and \"Supa Ugly,\" and Nas won with 58% while Jay-Z got 42% of the votes. By 2005, the two rappers had eventually ended their feud without violence or animosity. During Jay-Z\'s I Declare War - Power House concert, Jay-Z announced to the crowd, \"It\'s bigger than \'I Declare War\'. Let\'s go, Esco!\" Nas then joined Jay-Z onstage, and the two then performed \"Dead Presidents\" together, which Jay-Z had sampled from Nas\' song \"The World is Yours.\"\n\n2002–Present: From God\'s Son to Street\'s Disciple and beyond\n\nIn December 2002, Nas released the God\'s Son album. and its lead single, \"Made You Look\". The album debuted at #18 on the Billboard charts despite widespread internet bootlegging. Time Magazine named his album best hip-hop album of the year. Vibe Magazine gave it 4 stars and The Source gave it 4 mics. The second single, the inspirational \"I Can\", which reworked elements from Beethoven\'s \"Fur Elise\", became Nas\' biggest hit to date during the spring and summer of 2003, garnering substantial radio airplay on urban, rhythmic, and top 40 radio stations, as well as on the MTV and VH1 music video networks. God\'s Son also includes several songs dedicated to memory of Nas\' mother, who died of cancer in 2002. In 2003, Nas was featured on the Korn song \"Play Me\", from KoЯn\'s Take a Look in the Mirror LP.\n\nNas released his seventh studio album, the critically acclaimed double-disc Street\'s Disciple, on November 30, 2004. The album\'s first singles were \"Thief\'s Theme\" and \"Bridging the Gap\", which features his father Olu Dara on vocals. The album also includes \"These are Our Heroes\", which accuses prominent sports stars and actors such as Kobe Bryant, Lenny Henry, Tiger Woods, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. of neglecting their heritage and background in favour of white values. The videos for \"Bridging the Gap\" and \"Just A Moment\" received moderate airplay on MTV and BET. Although the album went platinum, its commercial profile was relatively low compared to the rapper\'s previous releases.\n\nNas was featured on Kanye West\'s album Late Registration on a song titled \"We Major\". West said the song was Jay-Z\'s favorite on the album, but West was unable to get Jay-Z to record a vocal for the final mix of the song. He also appeared on Damian Marley\'s song \"Road to Zion\" (which also featured newcomer The Game in the video, widening Nas\' still growing universally appreciated raps) and several other songs such as \"Death Anniversary\" and \"It Wasn\'t You\" (featuring Lauryn Hill). In addition, Nas was most recently married to the R&B singer Kelis, who is mostly known for her work internationally, but nonetheless released great hits in the U.S. The couple wed on Jan. 8, 2005 in Atlanta, GA, after a two-year engagement.\n\nDuring this time, Nas announced that his next album would be entirely self-produced and feature no other rappers, and would be titled Nasir, and later that the project would feature other producers after all and would be called Nasdaq: Dow Jones. Neither of these albums ever materialized.\n\nAt a free concert in Central Park, New York, Nas made a statement regarding the quality of 50 Cent\'s music. \"this is the real shit, not that 50 Cent shit!\" In response, 50 Cent included a stab at Nas by speaking negatively of his wife Kelis on his single \"Piggy Bank,\" implying that Kelis was promiscuous and calling Nas a \"sucker for love.\" Nas was quoted as saying that he feels no obligation to retaliate, remarking \"[50 has] got a good five to six more albums before I can really respond to him.\" Nas eventually decided to retaliate, and in July 2005 released \"Don\'t Body Ya Self (MC Burial)\", a song which taunts 50 Cent and his G-Unit crew, stating that 50 was \"a sucka for death if I\'m a sucka for love.\" However, despite all of this, Nas still claims to \"have a lot of love towards 50,\" claiming 50 didn\'t understand his moves when they both were together at Columbia Records.\n\nIn January 2006, Nas signed a label deal with Jay-Z\'s Def Jam, further emphasizing the Jay-Z/Nas truce and raising expectations for a collaboration even higher. His album due in fall of 2006 will come out in a joint deal with this imprint and Columbia Records. He recently announced to MTV News that his album is to be named, \"Hip Hop is Dead...the N,\" the N being a play on the word the \"end.\" The title is supposed to reflect what some would term the current low quality of rap music. The highly anticipated album is due out in December 19th, 2006.\n\nMusical style and Technique\n\nNas has long been famed for his creativity and storytelling prowess, which has earned him acclaim from both the hip-hop community and critics. In his early stages, from his first appearance on the Main Source\'s Breaking Atoms and throughout the recording of Illmatic, he was perhaps best known for his street-oriented topics, complex lyrical schemes (which often incorporated multi-syllabic internal rhymes), and witty phrasing and imagery. As he progressed and matured, Nas began to branch out into different subjects and developed a richer voice and slower rapping technique.\n\nFollowing Illmatic\'s release, Nas developed a penchant for hyper-visual storytelling and topical creativity. For instance, \"Undying Love\" (featured on I Am...) is a tale of his wife\'s betrayal told in first person, \"Rewind\" (featured on Stillmatic) is a narrative in which a story is recited backwards, while on \"I Gave You Power\" (featured on It Was Written), Nas assumes the role of a gun who recounts brutal tales of murder and violence. Over the years Nas\' style has changed significantly. In contrast to his previous work, Nas’ most recent material is distinctively socially aware and often politically inflammatory. Songs such as \"I Can\" (featured on God\'s Son) convey moral messages of black youth empowerment, while \"These Are Our Heroes (Coon Picnic)\" accuses several African-American celebrities of being Uncle Toms. Furthermore, controversial songs such as \"My Country\" and \"A Message to the Feds (Fuck The Police II)\" (which are featured on Stillmatic and Street\'s Disciple, respectively) question the conduct of the American government. Nas\' views in his lyrics throughout his career have made references to Islam and the Five Percent Nation..',3345834,138567457),(156,'Naughty By Nature','Naughty by Nature is a hip hop group that at the time of its formation in 1991, consisted of Treach, Vinnie, and the DJ Kay Gee. \n\nThe group formed in East Orange, New Jersey, and first appeared on the music scene in the late 1980\'s releasing an album titled The Independent Leaders, under their then name The New Style. The album generated the minor hit \"Scuffin\' Those Knees\". After the release of their first album, the group was subsequently mentored by fellow New Jersey native Queen Latifah and consequently changed their name.\n\nTheir first hit as Naughty By Nature was a track titled \"O.P.P.\" (\"Other People\'s Parts\"), which sampled the The Jackson 5\'s hit \"ABC\" and was released in 1991 on their self-titled debut album. The album also generated another hit titled \"Ghetto Bastard\" (the track is often referred to as \"Everything\'s Gonna Be Alright\"). Fellow New Jersey native Tony D, accused Naughty by Nature of stealing a sample from his breakbeat album Music Makes You Move and using it on their track \"O.P.P.\". The matter was settled out of court. Later they had multiple hits from their third and fourth albums, titled 19 Naughty III and Poverty\'s Paradise respectively.\n\n\"Hip Hop Hooray\" was a success from the album 19 Naughty III. Its video was directed by Spike Lee and featured other hip-hop artists popular in the early 1990\'s, including Queen Latifah, Eazy-E, and Kris Kross.\n\nThe group also scored a major hit with the track \"Uptown Anthem\", from the soundtrack to the 2Pac movie Juice.\n\nIn later years, Naughty by Nature started their own music imprint, Illtown Records, and released an album from their proteges the Rottin Razkals. The group (mainly Kaygee) worked closely with a number of rnb groups over the years particularly Zhané and Next.\n\nAn ongoing dispute between Kaygee and Treach saw Kaygee leave Naughty by Nature in late 2000 to concentrate on his Divine Mill label. The remainder of the group released an album in 2002 titled IIcons, using a variety of different producers including Da Beatminerz - the album however received a lukewarm reception from the public. Treach is rumoured to be releasing a solo album soon. Kaygee has been extremely successful building his Divine Mill imprint with 2 platinum plus albums on both (Divine Mill acts) Jaheim and Next as well as songs on albums from Syleena Johnson and Charlie Wilson among others. In May 2006 Kay Gee reunited with Treach and Naughty by Nature at a concert at B.B. King\'s nightclub.  They will be working together on their next album.',789179,6768229),(157,'Mystikal','Michael Lawrence Tyler (born September 22, 1970 in New Orleans, Louisiana), better known by his stage name Mystikal, is a Grammy award nominated American rapper and actor.

He has plans to return to recording music and possibly release a new album sometime in 2010. He is one of many artists from Master P\'s No Limit Records to achieve both critical and commercial success. \n\nMichael Tyler went to Cohen High School in New Orleans. Later he would go on to be in the Army and serve as a Meal, Ready-to-Eat supply clerk assigned to a stateside support unit.\n\nHis debut album was Mystikal, released on the indie label Big Boy Records in 1995. He signed to Jive Records to release Mind of Mystikal in 1996. The album sold well, and he signed to Master P\'s No Limit Records for Unpredictable in 1997. The album sold well, and garnered him critical praise, though his real breakthrough was Let\'s Get Ready released in 2000, led by The Neptunes-produced hit \"Shake Ya Ass,\" and the only slightly-less-successful single \"Danger (Been So Long),\" which featured rising pop star Nivea. It debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200, making it his only chart-topper to date.\nOne of his most recent releases was the 2001 album Tarantula, which contained the single, \"Bouncin\' Back (Bumpin\' Me Against The Wall)\". Though it presented Mystikal\'s typical and unique flow style, the song also saw a blending of jazz and swing elements with hip-hop. He was also featured on \"Move Bitch\" by Ludacris.\nOn January 16, 2004 Mystikal was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to forcing his hairstylist to perform sex acts. He also admitted to extortion. The rapper and two bodyguards forced the woman to perform oral sex after they accused her of stealing $80,000 in checks. Mystikal initinally denied the assault, but confessed after a videotape of the crime was found at his home. Bodyguards Leland \"Pokie\" Ellis and Vercy \"V\" Carter also pled guilty to sexual battery.  Mystikal\'s 2006 parole hearing led to a denial of parole, specifically \"1002186 SEXUAL BATTERY OF INFIRM\" and \"702127 EXTORTION.\"\nHe is currently incarcerated at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, which is just outside of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His D.O.C. number is 00469659.\n\nIn August 2005, while incarcerated on the state sexual battery and extortion charges, Mystikal was charged federally with two misdemeanor counts of failing to file tax returns for 1998 and 1999.

Redman\'s 1992 Def Jam debut Whut? Thee Album broke into the US Top 50, achieved gold status in the United States, and prominent hip-hop magazine The Source subsequently named Redman Rap Artist of the Year for 1993.\n\nRedman\'s solo career continued throughout the remainder of the decade, with each of his albums selling at least half a million copies. His musical style has remained very consistent, rarely deviating from a combination of Redman\'s unique braggadocious wit and hard, P-funk-influenced beats. In addition to releasing albums under his own name, he is part of the group Def Squad (along with Keith Murray and Erick Sermon) with whom he released the 1998 album El Nino, and also has formed a close partnership with labelmate Method Man (of the Wu-Tang Clan) with whom he released the 1999 album Blackout!.  The long-awaited follow-up, Blackout! 2, apeared in 2009. \n\nHe has also collaborated extensively, both with hip-hop artists and with artists from other genres; the long list of artists and groups he has worked with includes Wyclef Jean, Snoop Dogg, Scarface, The Offspring, Christina Aguilera, Eminem, Gorillaz, D\'Angelo, Me\'shell Ndegeocello, 2Pac, Jodeci, Cypress Hill, De La Soul, KRS One and IAM.\n\nIn 2001 Redman co-starred with Method Man in the stoner comedy film How High, which featured the pair playing two marijuana-addled students attempting to survive at Harvard. Method Man and Redman also appear in the Def Jam Vendetta video game series, often as Tag Team partners, and briefly had their own television sitcom, Method & Red, on Fox during the 2004-2005 season.\n\nRedman is also featured on the video game \"True Crime: New York City\", in which the central character interacts with an undercover street cop based upon the rap star, who also provides the voice for him.\n\nAliases\n    * Funk Doc\n    * Funk Doctor Spock\n    * Doc\n    * Reggie\n    * Reggie Noble\n    * Soopaman Luva\n\n\nDiscography:\n\nAlbums\n    * 1992: Whut?

He began his career in the group Cash Money Click and released his debut solo album, Venni Vetti Vecci, in 1999. He has since released 2000\'s Rule 3:36, 2001\'s Pain Is Love, 2002\'s The Last Temptation, 2003\'s Blood in My Eye and 2004\'s R.U.L.E. He now plans to release his seventh studio album, Venni Vetti Vecci 2010, sometime later this year.\n\nHe is best-known for hits \"Put It On Me\", \"Between Me And You\", \"Wonderful\" and for being associated with Jay-Z as a part of The Murderers. Ja Rule has sold over 20 Million albums worldwide and has released six albums with one on the way. His best-selling albums are Pain Is Love and Rule 3:36. Ja Rule has beefed with rappers DMX, 50 Cent, The Game, Busta Rhymes, Dr. Dre, and Eminem.\n\nEarly life:\n\nHe attended Junior High School in Floral Park, New York, where he met his future wife Aisha Murray and they graduated in 1991. They attended Martin Van Buren High School together but he did not graduate. When Atkins was five years old, his sister died from respiratory problems. Growing up in a strict religious home, Atkin\'s family did not celebrate birthdays and Christmas, and as a child, was not allowed to listen to rap music. When he first heard it, he decided to be a rapper. He would sneak the music into his house and played it on his CD player when his mother wasn\'t around. Atkins is married to his high school sweetheart, Aisha Atkins née Murray.They have three children: Brittney (11), Jeffrey Junior (6) and Jordan (3).He and his family live in a mansion in New Jersey.\n\nRise to Fame:\n\nAt age 15, Atkins appeared with 0-1 and Chris Black as part of Cash Money Click. This would lead to him being signed by TVT Records in 1994. He would end up being heard by a young DJ who called himself DJ Irv, then later Irv Gotti. Gotti, was a friend of Jay-Z\'s and he was also a DJ for Def Jam Recordings. During the mid 90s his main priority was meeting Ja Rule. He wanted to sign Ja to his new label Murder Inc. Records. He wanted Ja because of his distinct deep voice. After Irv was able to sign Ja along with DMX and Jay-Z to Def Jam. He began to have an idea that they all work together. They formed a group named The Murderers. They recorded many songs together. Friction tore the group apart, DMX, a rapper that sounds very similar to Ja accused him of trying to steal his style with the deep voice, by saying that before the three were signed Ja tried to make his voice sound lighter but heard him embrace the deep voice and tried to imitate it. They had planned to release an album together, but this idea was scrapped and they all made appearances on their respective albums. Still, around this time, Ja Rule was still fairly unknown. Jay-Z, at the time a young star and new to Def Jam, was the most popular rapper in hip hop. Russell Simmons had the idea that in order to build hype around Ja Rule and capitalize on Jay\'s popularity that Ja Rule do a verse on Jay-Z\'s 1998 single Can I Get A..., which also featured Amil. Ja\'s performance of the verse made him a household name and he became an instant star and by the release of his album a year later he was one of Def Jam Recordings premier acts.',1272192,11310446),(161,'Busta Rhymes','Trevor George Smith Jr. (born May 20, 1972 in Brooklyn, New York), better known by his stage name Busta Rhymes, is an American rapper and actor signed to Universal Motown. He began his rap career in the group Leaders of the New School, and had his breakout moment when they featured on A Tribe Called Quest\'s hit, Scenario. Busta then released his debut album, The Coming, in 1996. He has since released 1997\'s When Disaster Strikes, 1998\'s E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event): The Final World Front, 2000\'s Anarchy 2001\'s Genesis, 2002\'s It Ain\'t Safe No More, 2006\'s The Big Bang and 2009\'s Back on My B.S. His ninth studio album, The Chemo, will be released early 2010 and is said to be 80% completed. \n\nBorn to parents Geraldine Green (1947) and Trevor George Smith Sr, and he has a younger brother, Paul Smith. His parents divorced when he 10 years old. Busta’s time during the year of 1983 was that of change, his parents got divorced and his way of thinking was altered, during that year he also changed his religious beliefs and re-named himself ‘Born Justice God Allah’ because of the supreme sorts of names that he now believed in and looked up to. He discovered hip hop music through listening to the Zulu Beats Radio Show, something influenced him from that show and three years later he would form a group. Busta also went to school in the United Kingdom, where he lived in Blackpool, Preston and Morecambe. Ended up graduating from George Westinghouse High School in downtown Brooklyn. \nAs a youngster he played basketball, football and soccer.\n\nHis Panamanian baby-sitter, Aunt Mitzi, made him listen to all the rap radio stations. So, He would sit there at 2 in the morning rapping when he was supposed to be sleeping. I just couldn\'t be too loud or Mitzi\'s poodle would start dancing around and barking. One night, the poodle barked and Mitzi took my radio away. So he said, \"I don\'t need that radio. I\'ll write my own rap songs.\" Busta Rhymes later became part of a B-Boy crew with mainly latinos, a couple of white kids, and Busta, the only black one. When he was about 10 years old after he moved from Brooklyn to Long Island, where he became a member of the crew when it was a big contest happening which the leader of the crew, Johnny Juice watched. Busta just came up to him like, \"Are you Johnny Juice?\" and Johnny answered like \"Yeah.\" and he said he wanted to be down with this crew. He started poppin\' and Johnny said he was dope so he said \"We\'re about to do this contest\" and they wanted to put him down with them, but he didn\'t know the routines. But they put him down anyways and they lost the contest because they didn\'t know where to put him in the routine. The next contest they had was more of a battle, for the crown of best b-boys in Long Island and they had their crew there and they won. Busta destroyed these other guys, when he was poppin. Johnny Juice says \"even if you listen to his rhymes now, you can tell by the way he rhymes and the way he moves around he\'s really dope on the popping shit\".\n\nBefore his leap to stardom, Rhymes, was a rambunctious middle-class kid from Long Island who wrote \"rap poetry\" and dropped out of high school to pursue a music career. \"I really thought he\'d be a dancer,\" says his mother, Geraldine Green. \"At family cookouts he would win all the dance contests. He was always a showman.\" He reminds his worst job: “I used to work as a stock boy at a department store called Cheap John’s,” he says. “I knew that I couldn’t really wrap my head around doing that kind of work. Even if your heart is not in something, your mind has to at least be able to be willing to do it. So, I took the job and I worked for about two weeks, and then I quit.” Why?\n“They just had me doing too much. I had to line up the roach sprays on the shelves and make sure they were all in order, facing the same way, with the logos facing the front. The dishwashing liquids, the detergents, the boxes that they came in when they came from the actual shipping companies that they were manufactured at. After I lined them up on the shelves, I had to cut up the cardboard boxes, fold them up neatly and tie them up so that they could do the recycling thing with them. After a couple paper cuts too many, and hands that were calloused and ashy and bruised, I said ‘this is definitely not the thing for me to continue to be doing.’”\n\nBusta adds, “I used that as inspiration to go into the studio all the time when I had a free moment. After work, during my lunch break, traveling back and forth to work … to just apply myself creatively, and the opportunity finally came one day when I was downtown.” At 17, Rhymes landed a six-figure record deal.\n\nLONS signing with Elektra\n\nHis first name as a rapper was Chill-o-ski, but he thought it was a corny name, and Chuck D from Public Enemy gave him a new name, Busta Rhymes. He got the name from an american football player from the eighties, George \"Buster\" Rhymes, and people always asked him to \"Bust-a-rhyme\", so the choice was easy. In the end of the eighties he met Charlie Brown at Turtlehook Middle School and they formed Leaders of the New School with Dinco \"The rhyme scientist\" D and Milo In De Dance (aka The Cut Monitor). They were on Rush Management. They was signed to Elektra Records December 12th 1989. First Recorded Appearance: “Mt. Airy Groove” from the Rubaiyat compilation, Elektra 1990. A&R Dante Ross heard about Leaders of the New School from Hank Shocklee [Bomb Squad] and Chuck D [Public Enemy] and them.He says \"I knew they were one of their burgeoning groups and I also knew they didn\'t have a record deal. I heard they were performing and I went to check them out. I had just got my A&R gig at Elektra. I went there, saw them perform, grabbed them right after the performance and told them they had a record deal if they wanted one. LONS released 2 albums, \"A future without a past\" in 1991, and \"T.I.M.E.\" in 1993. In 1992 Busta\'s girl was pregnant, but the baby died right after he was born, and Busta had big personal problems after that, but he got great support from his group members. In 93 they where divided because of ego in the group.\n\nA couple of other things that made him well known before his solo career was a couple of cameo performances, among them A Tribe Called Quest\'s remix of \"Scenario\" with Leaders Of The New School, and the \"Flava in ya ear remix\" with Craig Mack and Rampage.\n\nIt took Busta three years before he released an album for Elektra, in 1996 he released \"The Coming\" with the hits \"Woo hah! Got you all in check\" featuring Rampage and \"It\'s a party\" featuring Zhane. while recording his debut album, he left the studio to check on his new SUV. He\'d recently purchased the Toyota Land Cruiser, a giant vehicle that gives the impression of driving on an elevated track, for $40,000. Rhymes took the elevator down and came out on Broadway, in lower Manhattan, at 11:30 p.m. His ride was gone. Furious, he marched back inside and closed the door in the recording booth. \"There was nothing I could do at that point, so I just vented that angry energy into three songs,\" he says. Woo-Hah!! Got You All in Check, one of the tracks he completed by morning, went on to become a street anthem and crossover hit, his first ever.\n\nThere was a short gap between the release of Busta’s first album and his second album, but it came sooner than people imagined it to. Busta was sceptical about bootleggers copying the new album so for reviewing purposes he only sent out album samplers. In 1997 he released his second album, \"When Disaster Strikes\", and after that, his popularity exploded. 1998 became a very good year for Busta, he started his own clothing line, BUSHI designs, and released his third album \"Extinction Level Event (The final world front)\" and Flipmode Squad\'s debut \"The Imperial\". Flipmode Squad at that point included Busta Rhymes, Rah Digga, Spliff Star, Rampage, Baby Sham & Lord Have Mercy. \n\n1999 became a year with problems for Busta, he had to visit the courthouse a couple of times because of child support, and police stopped his car and found an unregistered gun. He lost the case about child support, and he got a 5 year probation for the other case. Now Elektra started to shut him down with less studio time and promotion for his next album. Busta didn\'t like that, and took his squad over to J Records in 2001 after his fourth release in 2000, \"Anarchy\".\n\nJ Records\n\nHis first album at J was \"Genesis\", with the hits \"What it is\" featuring Kelis, \"Break ya neck\" & \"Pass the courvoiser part 2\" featuring Pharrell and P. Diddy. Now he is CEO for Flipmode Records. In november 2002 he released his most fervent album so far, \"It Ain\'t Safe No More\" with the singles \"Make it clap\" featuring Spliff Star, and a remix of it featuring Spliff Star and Sean Paul. Other achievements in 2002 was the movie roles he had in \"Halloween: Resurrection\" and \"Narc\". In 2003 his SUV was shot up with 6 bullets while he was in the Violator offices, that happened just a month after a couple of people shot inside their offices. The collaboration with Mariah Carey & Flipmode Squad named \"I know what you want\" on \"It ain\'t safe no more\" became Busta\'s biggest hit so far.\n\nAftermath\n\nIn February 2004, Flipmode Squad joined Aftermath Records, New members was added to the squad: M. Dollars, Labba and former Blackstreet Chauncey Black joined them. In March he got a six month probation sentence after pleading no contest to a charge that he assaulted a woman during a concert in Fall River, Massachusetts, in December 2002.\n\nIn November 2005 the first official single off the album \"Touch it\" was released to radio. The video premiered in December. He is now the father of four children (born in 93, 99, 00 and 02). In February, while making the second video for \"The Big Bang\"- the \"Touch it remix\" ft. Mary J. Blige, Missy, Rah Digga, Lloyd Banks, Papoose and DMX, one of his bodyguards, Israel Ramirez, who recently started working security for Busta as his jewelry handler, was shot and killed shortly after midnight outside of the Kiss The Cactus Production studio in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, NY. According to eyewitnesses, the shooting was a result of an argument that began inside the studio and continued outside.\n\nThe Aftermath chief Dr. Dre said before the release of The Big Bang that ”All of sudden I’m hearing people in the streets talking about hos Busta’s back. In my mind, he never left, and that’s why I wanted to fuck with in the first place. He’s got that drive, and he never stops trying to top himself. Anybody who knows Busta knows that he’s always gonna come with heat.\" His third video from \"The Big Bang\" was released 10th May, \"I love my bitch\". The video features actress Gabrielle Union and the Black Eyed Peas\' Will.i.am, who produced the song, but Kelis who is featured on the song, was not in the video. The single also features Kelis, but she\'s not featured in the video. Also changed is his appearance, as he has cut off his trademark dreadlocks as part of a personal renewal. \"Eight years of court appearances later and I was awarded custody of my children,\" he explained. \"My hair was remindful of the unnecessary rocks in my career and life. So it was time to shed the locks... I\'ve got my career and family right.\" \"The Big Bang\" was released 13th June. The fourth video was released in July, \"New York shit\" and the fitth video came out in August, \"In the ghetto\". The album was certified Gold in that month too. This month he was also charged with an assault after the Amsterjam Music Festival on Randalls Island, and he was ticketed after police saw him talking on his mobile while driving past a Manhattan police station.\n\nOn January 3rd 2007 he turned himself in to police custody after he allegedly attacking someone on Boxing Day. Lt. John Grimpel said a man told police that Rhymes, had punched and kicked him repeatedly after an argument over money. On May 3rd was arrested on a drunk driving charge by police in New York City. Officers stopped Rhymes at about 12:40 a.m. because the sport utility vehicle he was driving had overly tinted windows, officers then smelled alcohol on the rapper\'s breath and he was subsequently arrested. was released on $7,500 bail, set by Judge Tanya Kennedy. After a 8th May court appearance, he was free to drive. Rhymes\' lawyer said a judge ruled against a prosecution motion to suspend the rapper\'s license following the driving-while-intoxicated arrest. He also turned down a plea deal that day that would have sent him to jail for one year, the Manhattan district attorney\'s office said.\n\nBus appeared in a Super Bowl finale commercial for Pepsi Max Diet in February. Busta Rhymes pleaded guilty on 23rd January to assault, two driving infractions and weapons possession, avoiding a trial and the yearlong prison sentence recommended by prosecutors. But Judge Larry Stevens disagreed with prosecutors that Rhymes deserved time behind bars. Instead, he sentenced him to three years\' probation and 10 days of community service for beating a fan who reportedly spat on his car in August 2006, and then assaulting his driver, Larry Hackett, that December. Rhymes was also fined $1,250 for driving with a suspended license in 2006 and driving while intoxicated in 2007. \"I just want to say that I\'m very grateful to the judge, I\'m very grateful to the system. I believe in the system. It hasn\'t failed me personally yet,\" Rhymes, dressed in a crisp black pinstripe suit, said outside the courtroom.\n\"I\'m just glad that all of this is finally behind me and I can go back to doing what I do best - making great music and great films and being a people person,\" he said.\n\nHis 8th solo album \"Blessed\" was set for a release in July 2008. First he called it \"When Hell Freeze Over\" then he changed it to \"Back On My B.S.\", a title Pharrell helped him come up with, last it was changed to \"Blessed\" in April 08. Rhymes was added to Projekt Revolution 2008 (summer tour), He was joining Linkin Park, Chris Cornell, The Bravery, and Ashes Divide on the main stage. After the first week of touring he had to leave the tour because of business matters; Late July he left Interscope, because they couldn\'t agree with Busta how to handle the final version of the album.\n\nMotown\n\nIn September 08 he his new deal was announced, with Motown/Universal. He then re-titled his album to \"Back On My B.S.\" The first single was released in October 2008, called \"Arab Money\" featuring Ron Browz. 2 remix videos with different guests were later releases in February 09. The second single, \"Hustler\'s Anthem 09\" was released in Febuary too. The third single\'s video \"Respect My Conglomerate\" was released in March. \"Back On My B.S.\" was released May 19th 09, and entered the Billboard chart at #5, after a lot of delays; 1st July 08, 9th Dec. 08, 10th Feb. 09, 24th March 09). In June, the video for \"If you don\'t know\" was released. The video for \"World Go Round\" will be released soon.',2148580,27070735),(162,'Llwybr Llaethog','Llwybr Llaethog (Welsh for Milky Way, although the Milky Way has several names in Welsh folklore) are an experimental Welsh language band that effectively mix such varied musical genres as rap, dub, reggae, hip hop, and punk in their music.\n\nFounded in the northern Welsh town of Blaenau Ffestiniog in 1985 by John Griffiths and Kevs Ford, the two teens had spent the seventies growing up in the decaying industrial surroundings of Blaenau Ffestiniog, Wales. The two were heavily influenced by reggae and the punk scene that was sweeping the UK. After several abortive attempts to start bands, the turning point came in 1984 when John Griffiths was on vacation in New York City and was impressed by a group of youths he saw at a nightclub breakdancing, and the sounds of MC Red Alert.\n\nAfter returning to Wales, Griffiths fixed on the idea of marrying hip hop and far left politics with his native Welsh language. Llwybr Llaethog\'s debut album was an EP released in 1986 for the Welsh record label Anhrefn Records and entitled Dull Di Drais. The album combined Llwybr Llaethog\'s leftist political messages with what would become the band\'s trademark sound of turntable scratching, audio sampling, hip-hop, and cut-and-paste production. The band were also heavily promoted by British radio d-jay John Peel.\n\nThe band remains quite popular in their homeland and have garnered a cult following throughout Great Britain and as far afield as the USA, Canada, and Australia.\n\nTheir Official Website:\nhttp://uk.geocities.com/llwybr_llaethog/',2101,26227),(163,'Subterrneo','',13,60),(164,'Ami Suzuki','Born February 9th, 1982 in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.\nJ-Pop singer also known as \"Amigo\" by her fans.',10305,337291),(165,'Sipho Gumede','For more information about this artist and his music, please feel free to visit  African Cream Music  record label on last.fm,and the African Cream Music\'s official website for biogs, downloads, and other information about this artist and others.\n\nA true icon, the late Sipho Gumede was an innovative and diverse performer.

Apathy went on many regional tours, and one national one. It was the latter that proved to be the downfall, as there was a major falling out on the national tour between two members and they never played together again, until a Punk Re-Union show in Omaha in 2008.',185489,3530189),(169,'2 Live Crew','2 Live Crew was an American hip hop group from Miami, Florida, which had its greatest commercial success from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. The group\'s most well-known line up was composed of Luke Campbell, Fresh Kid Ice, Mr. Mixx, and Brother Marquis.

The group consisted of Odario, Spitz, Breakz, and ICQRI. Their final album I Do My Own Stunts, was released in 2005, contained their first hit, \"Rocketship\". \n\nOdario and Spitz, met at Kelvin High School in Winnipeg. In the early 1990s the two members started recording their first demos on a karaoke machine in Spitz’s basement. They first started playing their music live in 1994, in small clubs around Toronto. “We were playing at this club called the 360 in Toronto and there were all of nine people there, five of which were from Winnipeg\" says Odario about one of their very first live shows. They also toured with punk and funk bands. \n\nTheir first hit was a single called \"No Hooks\" which received heavy rotation on Canada\'s Much Music video station and gained them national awareness. Their first album, Night.Live.Types, was released in 1999. The album was followed closely by their sophomore release, Politic Different. Both albums received positive reviews and did reasonably well in regards to album sales. \n\nTheir third album, Antarctica (Cold, Cold World), was released in 2002.

On this follow-up to the successful 2000 release “The Book of Daniel”, Scarborough’s Dan-e-o (whose name, contrary to popular belief, does NOT capitalize the “E” and “O” unless, of course, the entire name is written in caps) mixes elements of funk, soul, reggae and rock with heavy doses of street battle raps and conscious-minded lyricism. Touted as one of Canada’s greatest lyricists ever, Dan-e-o is best known for his first single, “Dear Hip Hop”, which was released on Beat Factory’s RapEssentials Volume One album in 1996.\n\nSince then, Dan-e-o has helped to establish his crew Monolith as a Canadian favourite in the world of hip-hop. Among Monolith’s members is the Juno nominated trio Irs (“Welcome to Planet Irs”) who produce and appear in “Stand Clear”. In the summer of 2004, the LP’s first single, “T.N.T.” charted on Canadian radio while its video rotated on MuchMusic, MuchVibe and MTV Canada. Next to burn up the same airwaves was the bouncy single and video “Funkbox” featuring future R&B diva, Chocolate Ty.\n\nJuno nominated DJ Serious (“Dim Sum”) is also on board to produce the cuts “Foxy Lady” and “Amazing” featuring Juno winner Blessed (“Love”), adding elements of soul and reggae to this funk-filled LP. Popular Jamaican reggae artist (and Dan-e-o’s distant cousin) Red Rat appears in the hot club banger “Kama Sutra”, which is a huge party anthem for summer 2005. All cuts make “See No Evil, Hear No Evil” an eclectic mix of beautiful and innovative music.\n\n“The negative images of violence, greed and ‘pimpery’ that clog the airwaves these days don’t impress everybody”, says Dan-e-o, “Mad hip-hop heads still just want to hear someone who can rap well, period”. Saying that Dan-e-o ‘raps well’ is like claiming Michael Jordan did a pretty good job of playing basketball during his career. And Dan-e-o plans to take his career to new heights with his sophomore album “See No Evil, Hear No Evil”.\n\nWhy “See No Evil, Hear No Evil”? Dan-e-o explains the album’s title: “Our world and therefore, our entertainment is often corrupt. Mad kids be emulating what they see and hear all the time. All these so-called thug rappers are really just smart, rich, businessmen. Everything I say in my music is something I can honestly say I live. And it doesn’t involve any portrayal of a negative, cruel or hurtful lifestyle. ‘See No Evil, Hear No Evil’… If you love good music, you’ll love my music”.\n\nThe LAST album from Dan-e-o, appropriately titled “Speak No Evil” is also out now!! Available exclusively on the streets and online, this LP contains hot new remixes including “Kama Sutra (Reblaze!)” and bangin’ brand new cuts like “Chocolate Love”.

The Oakland rapper first gained notoriety at age sixteen, when he dropped the pro-Black, anti-government classic, Ward of the State (1992.) Boasting fearless lyrics and a militant Islamic bent, the album identified Askari as an enemy of the establishment and an advocate for oppressed peoples everywhere. Unfortunately, Askari wasn’t able to enjoy the project’s success, as he caught a three-year bid immediately after its release.  It was a pattern that would repeat itself throughout the rapper’s career: each highly-anticipated album seemed to bring with it another jail term, preventing Askari from gaining any momentum or expanding his core audience. The process has been so consistent that it’s tempting to imagine a government conspiracy, especially given the inflammatory nature of songs like “Better Hide Tonight,” “Piggy Wiggy,” and “3 Strikes.” Despite the many setbacks, Askari has never watered down his message, and he’s now set to release his fourth album, The X Factor,with no legal troubles on the horizon. He remains defiantly unapologetic about his music. “It’s so much truth that the Devil don’t want people to have it,” says Askari, “so it’s gon’ raise a little tension. But they can’t do nothing but bear witness to it, ‘cause it’s the truth.”\n\nFor Askari X, “the truth” is the doctrine of the Nation of Islam, as preached by founder W.D. Fard and his disciple, The Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Whilemany rappers have flirtedwith NOI principles throughout the years, Askari is truly dedicated, delivering his message of social revolution in a religious context that can be difficult for the average listener to comprehend. Nevertheless, at the core of Askari’s lyrics is a call to action that resonates in and outside the Black Muslim community. Inspired by the African People’s Socialist Party, Askari rides for his own revolutionary clique, the loosely-knit collective known as RBG, or Revolutionary Black Guerrillas. The group counts among its members such BayArea legends as KeakDa Sneak, Yukmouth and Dru Down, but perhaps its most famous supporters are Dead Prez, who have pushed the movement on a national level with albums like RBG: Revolutionary But Gangsta (2004). While RBG lacks the organization it once had, Askari promises there will be a resurgence. “It’s about to be a roll call,” says the rapper. “There’s no confusion amongst the ranks; we just need to have a universal gathering.”\nReleases:\nWard Of The State (12\") 		Righteous Records 	 \nWard Of The State (CD) 		Righteous Records 	1992\nWard Of The State (LP) 		Righteous Records 	1992\nMessage To The Black Man (LP) 		Slow Motion Records 	1995\nMessage To The Black Man (CD) 		Slow Motion Records 	1996\nProduction:\nTurn Off The Radio: The Mixtape Vol. 2-Get Free Or Die Tryin\' (CD) 	Scared To Die 	Landspeed Records 	2003\nTurn Off The Radio: The Mixtape Vol. 2-Get Free Or Die Tryin\' (LP) 	Scared To Die 	Landspeed Records 	2003\nAppears On:\nOutta Control EP (12\") 	Gotta Go 	Dank Or Die Records 	1995\nOutta Control EP (CD) 	Gotta Go 	Dank Or Die Records 	1995\nOff Da Hook (LP) 	Kill No Killers 	Loud Records 	1996\nYou Reap What You Sow (CD) 		Trigga Lock 	1996\nBosses Will Be Bosses (CD, Album) 	Thinking Bout Home 	Dank Or Die Records 	1999\nLead The Way (CD, Album) 	Get That Paper 	Thump Records 	2000\nTracks Appear On:\nCell Block Compilation (CD, Comp) 	Fucked In The Game 	Cell Block Records, Priority Records 	1996\nInternational Blunt Funk Compilation (CD, Comp) 	Peckerwood, Peckerwood 	In-A-Minute Records, Blunt Funk Records 	1997\nGhost Ridin\' 101 (The Soundtrack) (CD, Comp) 	Burn 	Thizz Entertainment 	2007',1248,10035),(180,'Salaam Remi','Salaam Remi Gibbs, better known as Salaam Remi, is a hip hop producer and keyboard player, known for his association with Nas, Amy Winehouse, Fergie, Miguel and his reggae-tinged (often referred to as \"broken-bottle\") approach to production.

Memphis Bleek regularly came in contact with rap legends such as The Notorious B.I.G. and Jay-Z during his childhood, and has collaborated with artists such as Beanie Sigel, Ja Rule and Missy Elliott, among others. \"Memphis\" is an acronym for Making Easy Money Pimping Hoes In Style.\n\nEarly years\n\nMemphis \"One Hit Away\" Bleek\'s first mainstream rap vocals appeared on the Clark Kent produced song \"Coming of Age\", featured on Jay-Z\'s classic debut LP Reasonable Doubt. Shortly after, Bleek became the first artist signed to Roc-A-Fella Records.\n\n\"Coming of Age\", ironiclly, was also the title of Memphis\' debut LP, which didn\'t create massive records sales and chart-topping singles as his labelmate and peers\' albums had. The same was the case of his second LP, \"The Understanding\", and third, \"M.A.D.E\", though the latter spawned his largest amount of sales yet (900,000).\n\nGet Low label and rivalries\n\nIn the time between the releases of his second and third albums, Memphis Bleek started his own label, Get Low, which in turn led to the signing of former Junior MAFIA member Lil\' Cease. The name of the label has sparked a hip-hop rivalry, or beef, between Memphis Bleek, JT tha Bigga Figga & The Game, the former of which built an independent record label with the same title.\n\nMemphis Bleek was also caught in the middle of the epic Jay-Z and Nas battle, in which Bleek gained a few enemies, most notably Nas and Mobb Deep. Despite boosting Jay-Z and Nas\'s careers, the beef did little to help Bleek gain any more popularity than he had already attained.\n\nLater years\n\nRemaining one hit away, on May 17, 2005, Bleek released his fourth album titled \"534\" , in reference to the building he & mentor Jay-Z grew up in, located in the Marcy housing projects of Brooklyn. However, like many of Bleeks previous releases the album suffered in sales, despite decent exposure of the Swizz Beatz produced single \'Like That\'.\n\nIn fall 2005, Memphis Bleek told MTV that he was recording an album called \"The Process\", that he would describe as a make or break album, saying \"I want to do an album that\'s through the roof, I want to do a classic album. I feel that if this album I\'m not recording is a classic, I\'m not even gonna put it out. I have to do it bigger than anybody has ever done it.

He released his debut album, Ghetto Fabolous in 2001 and has since released 2003\'s Street Dreams, 2004\'s Real Talk and 2007\'s From Nothin\' To Somethin\', all of which have collectively sold over four million copies in the United States. His fourth studio album, Loso\'s Way, was released in July of 2009 and debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nIt takes talent to make the struggle to succeed seem effortless, but that is the gift that separates artists like Brooklyn\'s John Jackson, aka Fabolous, from the everyday MC. While most rappers spend more and more time convincing the masses of their \"hustle,\" Fabolous lets his work speak for his effort. With two platinum albums (2001\'s Ghetto Fabolous and 2003\'s Street Dreams) and one Gold (2004\'s Real Talk) to his credit, the veteran hitmaker still exudes a rookie-of-the year swagger. After recording for both Elektra and Atlantic Records, Fab is enjoying a home coming with the legendary Def Jam label. His first recorded song was \"If They Want It\" from DJ Clue\'s The Professional, which was released by Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam in 1998.\n\n\"I had people in my corner already over there,\" Fab says of DJ Clue and A&R Skane, the Desert Storm duo who discovered Fabolous. \"So it wasn\'t like I was coming to a new neighborhood.\"\n\nWhile he doesn\'t site any one reason for his move, Fabolous has learned a lot from his time in the industry and is eager to capitalize on his experience. \"I haven\'t peaked yet,\" he explains. \"I was happy with the past records, but I have some adversity to learn off of for the future.\"\n\nIt\'s appropriate that Fabolous is getting a fresh start for his latest release because he wants From Nothin\' to Somethin\' to be a rebirth for his fans old and new. \"Everybody is trying to take what they have and make something more,\" says Fabolous, explaining the album\'s title. \"It\'s a new year, everybody\'s on their hustle, back in the gym and I\'m trying to give them some inspiration. This is music to chase your money too, work out--motivation music.\n\nThe first single \"Make Me Better\" is produced by Grammy Award winning producer Timbaland and finds Fabolous doing what he does best; blending radio ready sound beds with clever and memorable lyrics. Rapping that he needs \"a Corretta Scott to make me King\" Fab picks up with his female fans where \"Baby\" left off. \"It\'s a great feel good record, it\'s got a lot of style to it,\" he says. \"I wanted a record that could show that I could touch different people with my music.\"\n\nAlready recognized for his hit-making ability, Fabolous is eager to show the diversity of his technique while staying true to his blueprint for success. On the cocky \"Make Money\" he cleverly borrows Notorious B.I.G\'s trademark chuckle to comment on the laugh-ability of his competition: \"these dudes is stand up rappers, hip-hop comedians, I start laughin as soon as I put your CD in.\" His wit and wordplay is not something he gets enough credit for, but the MC is confident people will come around. \"Certain people recognize it,\" he says, \"but its like they\'ll sing it in the shower, but they won\'t sing it outside. It\'s all good though. One of them days you gonna get drunk and start singing that song.\"\n\nEnlisting a whose-who list of guests that includes Akon, Young Jeezy, Ne-Yo and Junior Reed, Fabolous plays to a variety of audiences on this disc, but there is no mistaking that it\'s his show from beginning to end. The anthemic \"Brooklyn\" features a yet to be disclosed surprise guest and \"Change Up\" pairs Fab with singer, producer extraodinaire Akon helping him reflect on his life and career.\n\n\"Anytime you become a successful person, people may look at you and say you changed,\" explains Fabolous, who references the October 2006 shooting that took place outside of Justin\'s restaurant in the lyrics of the song. \"That record just talks about people changing as a person for money, how they carry themselves and treat other people. For me, I might have changed where I live or my number, but I haven\'t changed as a person…I slid a line or two about what happened in October but I\'m not coming out with a bullet proof vest or anything.\"\n\nThe playful \"Foggin Up The Windows,\" produced by Miami\'s The Runners, features R. Kelly\'s chopped and screwed vocals from his hit \"Ignition\" to prop up Fabolous\' ode to parkin\' lot pimpin\' of the more carnal kind.\n\n\"I just took it back to trying to get some in the car,\" he says with a laugh. \"Everyone\'s either done it or tried to get some in the car. It may not have been the place of choice but everybody\'s had a hotel on wheels.\"\n\nOther rewind worthy tracks like \"Real Playa\" featuring Lloyd, \"Diamonds\" featuring Young Jeezy and the Just Blaze produced \"Back To School\" round out an impressive collection that makes From Nothin\' to Somethin\' worth the two-year wait. In his absence no artist has come close to matching his boyish charm, wit and unassuming cool both on and off the mic. With a new team and a pop of his collar Fabolous is indeed \"fresh to Def.\"\n\n\"I\'m trying to bring good music back to the game,\" he says confidently. \"And anybody that\'s bringing good music, the hype is gonna follow them.\"',1888065,17376512),(189,'Baby D','There are 2 Artists that go by the name Baby D.\n\n1.

He resides in Los Angeles, California although he launched his musical career within the underground hip hop scene of Chicago, IL. He is known also as Offwheezy.\n\nCareer\n\nOffwhyte\'s most recent release is Mainstay, his third full-length album, a work filled with charismatic philosophies, potent verbal imagery, and a wide range of musical styles.\n\nOffwhyte started performing in the late 1990s, spitting raps at hip hop parties and open mic poetry nights. He attended the University of Illinois at Chicago with his long-time friend Jeff Kuglich. There they met a graffiti writer and painter, JASH of Chicago’s legendary DC5 crew. The three developed a friendship that would become the foundation of Galapagos4 records.\n\nSquints by Offwhyte was released in February 2000. It was the second CD on the fledgling Galapagos4 label. Urb Magazine hailed it as \"ingenius\" and the Village Voice described it as “free-floating intelligence”. Hip hop heads took quick notice to Offwheezy’s lyrical dexterity and untamed production skills. The classic CD has been repressed several times and is considered to be the album that broke the monotony of Chicago \"battle rap\" that was prominent in the scene at that time.\n\nHis second album, The Fifth Sun, was released in November 2002. The album was licensed for foreign distriubtion by British electronica label Peacefrog, and Galapagos4 followed its release with their first European tour.

He is considered the forefather of hip-hop in Oakland and the Bay Area, California. Through his music, Too $hort has cultivated a persona of a no-nonsense pimp, and is widely credited for popularizing pimp culture in hip hop, along with Snoop Dogg, Ice-T and Slick Rick. In 1983, Too $hort released his first album, Don\'t Stop Rappin\', and he has since released sixteen more albums with each experiencing average sales of around 600,000 copies in the United States alone.',550630,4844000),(208,'Lyrikal','',8064,95764),(209,'Moka Only','With a catalogue that is unmatched by many, Moka Only is often considered to be a pioneer and driving force behind Canadian West Coast hip hop, as well as an important component in popularizing the art of freestyling in Victoria and Vancouver. In the 13+ years since his debut, Moka Only has released more than 40 albums, both solo and collaborative. He records under a variety of aliases, with the most popular being Ron Contour, Flow Torch and The Durable Mammal. He has been a contributing member of numerous groups and collectives, including Perfect Strangers, Code Name: Scorpion, Cryptic Souls Crew, The Dominant Mammals, City Planners, Nowfolk and Swollen Members, along with many others. Amongst all of that, Moka has worked with underground hip hop heroes like J Dilla, Aceyalone, OH NO, MF Doom, Buck 65, K-Os, Sixtoo and more. \n\nBut it all began rather humbly in his hometown of Victoria, BC, where Moka Only discovered hip hop culture at an early age, starting out as a graffiti artist before switching to rhyming at house parties and freestyling anywhere and everywhere alongside partner K-Prevail (recording together as Splitsphere). In 1994, Moka made the move to San Diego in order to further his rap career, creating a number of connections that he would later use to his advantage. Upon moving back to Canada in 1995 and taking up residence in Vancouver, Moka met Mad Child, and along with K-Prevail, now just Prevail, the three emcees founded Swollen Members one night at a Denny\'s, with Moka coining their multiple meaning name. However, a group dynamic was not for Moka and he soon moved on to a solo career. \n\nIn 1995, Moka Only started flooding the local scene with a myriad of music, quickly earning himself the nickname of “The Most Prolific” by self-releasing cassettes on an almost seasonal basis, which led to a few vinyl releases and finally album deals with a variety of labels. All the while, Moka was building a name for himself as a strong and skillful emcee with down-to-earth subject matter ranging from hip hop to fashion, from food to travel, and from love to sex. Although best known for his rapping, Moka was also building his resume as a a quirky producer with a knack for mixing live and sampled instruments. While the majority of Moka\'s musical output has been self-produced, his beats are also sought after by a wide range of underground artists, including Buck 65, who used one of his beats for his new album, Dirtbike 1/3. \n\nWith his solo career as both rapper and producer on the rise, Moka Only participated in a few collaborations with Swollen Members resulting in Moka rejoining the group for Monsters in the Closet, their 2002 collection of b-sides and rarities featuring three new songs. He remained on board for Heavy in 2003 but left again prior to the recording of Black Magic. Once again Moka had found himself confined as part of a group. \n\nHis time with Swollen Members, which also saw him signed to the Battle Axe label, resulted in three consecutive Junos, but it also meant a decrease in the amount of solo music from Moka. “The Most Prolific” returned in 2005 beginning with the release of The Desired Effect, his Nettwerk debut that realized a much greater pop potential for Moka. Unhappy with the label interference, Moka released a Japan-only alternate version under the title Dirty Jazz that was more to his liking, marking Moka\'s return to releasing the nearly seasonal albums of gritty, underground jams he has always been known for through labels like Camobear, Legendary Entertainment and Urbnet, as well as an occasional one-off project for various other indie labels.',119342,1040744),(210,'Orko Eloheim','West Coast underground legend Orko the Sycotik Alien.

For the electronic group, please correct your tags to The Prodigy.\n\n1) rapper from Mobb Deep\n2) group fronted by Todd Duane and Lale Larsen\n3) 90s teenage rapper\n4) 70s powerpop from Minnesota\n5) US progressive/power metal\n6) lounge jazz, alias of Miki Litvak\n7) 90s US metal\n8) US rapper in The Dominion\n\n1) Albert Johnson (born November 2, 1974 in Bradford, Brooklyn, New York and died on June 20, 2017 in Las Vegas), better known by his stage name Prodigy, was a member of the hip hop duo Mobb Deep. Prodigy worked as a solo artist since the early 2000s. He was born to parents of Ethiopian and Jamaican descent. Prodigy was born with sickle cell anemia and suffered from the disease throughout his life. Propelled to awareness partially by fellow Queens, New York rapper Nas, who took a similar approach lyrically on his championed \"Illmatic\" album from 1994, as well as with the aid of a successful single, \"Shook Ones Pt. 2,\" Mobb Deep suddenly found themselves developing a quickly growing cult. A year later, in 1996, Prodigy and Havoc released \"Hell on Earth\"; debuting at number six on SoundScan, the album found them fully realizing their approach, dropping both evocative beats and cinematic rhymes that communicated the dark side of New York\'s urban landscape. Thanks to a grim video for \"Hell on Earth (Front Lines)\" and theatrical Scarface-like photos inside the CD booklet picturing the duo with guns and a mound of cocaine, Mobb Deep had created an elaborate image for themselves that took hardcore gangsta rap to a new level for East Coast hip hop. Their next release, \"Murda Muzik\", was heavily bootlegged while still in its demo stage, leaking rough versions of the nearly 30 songs the duo had recorded onto the streets and over the internet.\n\nMonths after the bootlegs leaked and after several pushed-back street dates, \"Murda Muzik\" was formally released, debuting at number three on the Billboard charts and quickly going platinum on the strength of \"Quiet Storm,\" a song that epitomized the Mobb Deep style. The album was welcomed by critics, who again lauded the group\'s lucid cinematics, driven primarily by Havoc\'s production. In late 2000, Prodigy finally released his long-rumoured solo album, \"H.N.I.C.\", which saw the more lyrically gifted member of the group collaborating with outside producers such as The Alchemist and Rockwilder on tracks that didn\'t depart far from the trademark sullen Mobb Deep style. Their follow-up, \"Infamy\", was the duo’s last album for Loud, distributed by Columbia Records and was, for some, a disappointment lyrically and musically, while others praised it as amongst the best rap albums of the year. Loud was absorbed by its new distributor shortly afterwards.\n\nMobb Deep then signed with Jive, under a unique deal that gave the duo its own imprint, Infamous Records, and released \"Amerika\'z Nightmare\", a very uneven effort, which featured production by The Alchemist and Lil\' Jon. However, despite a successful single that featured a Thomas Dolby sample. The duo was not happy with Jive, and were let go at its request. The duo took a hiatus afterwards and came back in 2006, signing to 50 Cent’s Interscope/Universal-distributed G-Unit imprint. Their well-hyped \"Blood Money\" was a failure from the money side when compared to fellow label mates like 50 Cent, Young Buck and Lloyd Banks. Some accused the duo of selling out, with their beats and rhymes not up-to-par with previous efforts on Loud.\n\nHe completed work on his third solo album \"H.N.I.C. Part 2\", which was previewed on his official mixtape \"The Return of the Mac\" on the independent label Koch Records. The mixtape single and mixtape video are called \"Mac 10 Handle,\" and it shows Prodigy once again reverting to his trademark braids that he had prior to the release of Mobb Deep\'s 2004 \"Amerika\'z Nightmare\" album; different from the short fade he had from 2004 to 2006. \"H.N.I.C.

After a Switzerland tour with ‘Sendak’, the members of the crew all worked on their solo projects. The producer M. Kianicka left the formation. Now Pascal Scherrer joined them (DJ Showdown) and production was taken over by several Swiss production companies. Their first LP ‘So lauft’s mängisch’ was released on February 10 2006.

But if Jeffery James Logan—Catholic-born Chicago son, one-time Chuck Berry enthusiast, junior high schooler— knew one thing, he knew that he needed to play the drums. If he knew another thing, it was that he wouldn’t get to, no matter how much angsty teen protest or sullen-eyed brooding he put into the cause, because, well, some jock kid was in better with the gym teacher. \n\nSo Jeff—the SP-1200 beatmachine master we now know as jel—took up the coronet. Thankfully, the SP found jel shortly after Christmas one high school year. He’d been helping elderly women pump gas as part of a long-term scheme to turn fuel into money into circuitry into sound. He still had the tapes from the year he fell in love with music—1989 radio broadcasts from 105.9 WGCI, The Rap Down with Franky J and Disco Dave—and had been desperately searching for a way to feed his intense attraction to beat-making ever since his first urges were denied. With cash clenched tightly in young fist, he marched to the nearest music store and happily bought the cornerstone of his entire sound: the SP-1200. Revenge on a gym teacher never felt so sweet. And jel never looked back.\n\nThe next few years were spent mostly in two places. When jel wasn’t locked away in his room with his new mechanical love, he was helping out behind the scenes at Northwestern University’s radio station. At home he’d cut, chop, record, and tap; on campus he’d pass his tapes along to local DJs and emcees that would stop by the station. jel’s friend and radio partner Kevin Beacham introduced him to the hip-hop that came before, the secrets of the drum machine (i.e. how to cheat to 10-second sample time), and —most importantly—a certain nasaltoned Cincinnati rapper who went by the name of Dose One. The rest of jel’s story is the beginning stages and steady fruition of an entire movement in sound. In 1996, he quit art school in favor of the chills. In 1998, his first collaborations with Dose saw the light of day (Hemispheres). In January of 1999, the debut themselves LP Them was finished, and by Spring of the same year, work would begin on the seminal Deep Puddle Dynamics project. And from that record—which included jel and Dose One, Sole and Alias of Portland, Maine’s Live Poets, and Slug from Atmosphere—the concept of anticon (or the tag: anticon) was somewhere born.\n\nToday jel lives in the Oakland Bay Area with the same SP-1200 he purchased as a teen. They left the Midwest together in a concerted effort to defy genre with a collective of like-minded individuals and instruments. His crunchy punched-out beats and swells of low-bit atmospherics have become anticon trademarks, highly sought after by artists around the globe. jel was one of the first, if not the very first musician to use the a drum machine in live performance like a drum kit with little to no sequencing. Using the pads on the drum machine, jel plays each snare, bass kick, cymbal and loop with his fingers. And his raps ain’t half bad either. To date, jel’s list of collaborators includes Can’s Malcolm Mooney, Stephanie Bohm from Ms. John Soda, Mike Patton, Wise Intelligent of Poor Righteous Teachers, Black Thought of the Roots, DJ Krush, Mr. Dibbs, Sage Francis, Atmosphere, and just about the entire anticon roster, naturally. \n\njel is currently a member of themselves (with Dose One and Dax Pierson), Subtle (a cello-drums-samplers-guitar-keyboards-winds and words sextet on Lex Records), and 13 & God (themselves and the Notwist).

Discovered by 2 Live Crew\'s DJ/producer Mr. Mixx at local a talent show, they quickly were signed to Luke Skyywalker Records and released their debut album \"2 Low Life Muthas\" produced by Mr. Mixx. The group briefly took the subtitle \"Baby 2 Live Crew\" as a way to market themselves. Upon release, they received most of their attention due to the Miami Bass club hit \"Dance All Night\", a track that stylistically did not match the album\'s thuggish content.\n\nDebonaire left the group to spearhead his NYC Hip-Hop inspired act, \"Home Team\". JT Money continued on as Poison Clan, releasing the album \"Poisionous Mentality\" in 1992. It was again the act\'s Miami Bass single, \"Shake Whatcha Mama Gave Ya\", that gained them the most attention during this time, thanks in part to production by Kenneth \"Devastator\" Terry. Unlike \"Dance All Night\", this single was a major hit outside of the Southern club scene, and more importantly, became a blueprint for Miami Bass inspired acts for nearly the remainder of the decade.\n\nSuccessive albums include 1993\'s \"Ruff Town Behavior\", and and 1995\'s \"Strait Zooism\", which maintained the act\'s core following, setting the climate for other Miami based thug rappers such as Trick Daddy. However, much like the bulk of the Luke Records roster, JT Money began quesioning the label\'s practices, including the amount of unpaid royalties to him.

Working with Sacramento and Bay Area Rappers alike from a young age had some calling him a Bay Area Rapper, however Skanless was true to the streets that raised him and always called himself very distinctly a Sacramento Rapper.\n\nIn 1996, at 17 years old, Skanless signed with one of the hottest underground label at the time, 51/50 Records and dropped his first album \"The Book of Skanless.\" Still considered one of the best Sacramento rap albums of all time, \"The Book of Skanless\" included songs featuring the likes of 11/5 and Totally Insane and beats by Big Hollis. The album included the song \"Dirty Mackin\" which was featured on \"The Best of Sacramento\" album and the hit \"Ghetto Swang\" which received regular airtime on Sacramento\'s #1 rap station, 102.5.\n\nAfter splitting from 51/50 Records and signing with Out of Bounds Entertainment, Skanless released his second album, \"In The End We Shall Repent,\" in 1999. The album again included many beats by Big Hollis but this time featured the likes of G-Menace. A few months later he began a West Coast Tour with several Out of Bound Entertainment Artists that included stops throughout California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, and Arizona. However by age of 19, Skanless had lived a life most would only ever know of through Hollywood\'s depiction of rough inner city streets and gang life and the very life experiences that helped make his music real, honest, and raw also brought his rapidly expanding music career to a screeching halt as he was sent to Susanville\'s California State Prison for gun and drug charges just before turning 20. Released nearly 5 years later, he spent another 5 years in and out of prison on additional drug charges and parole violations but finally got off of parole in June of 2009.\n\nSkanless is now focused completely on his music and has learned in the last few years how to adapt to the many changes rap has gone through since the late 90\'s while making music that stays true to his life story and unique personal style still loved by many. Skanless is currently working on a few Mixtapes with various other local artists as well as a new album, not yet titled.

He often rapped about unique topics and had a interesting form of delivery. He also featured on many other artist\'s albums and has become something of a minor icon in the industry.\n\nHowever he is reported to have a very abrasive personality as there has been a fair amount of \'beef\' between him and other Hip Hop artists.',1707,17293),(225,'louis logic','Louis Logic started rapping at a young age but it wasn\'t until he attended Penn State in the mid/late 90s where he recorded his first release, \"Logistics 101\" which ended up being the B-side for his first 12 inch, \"Planet Rock\" featuring L-Fudge. Banking L-Fudge\'s popularity on Jedi Mind Trick\'s Superregular Records in 1998, Louis started gaining notoriety. He released a series of 12 inches  \"General Principal\" featuring J-Treds (with the widely favored B-side, \"Factotum\"), \"Loudmouth\" and \"Guilty As Charged\" while making connections with artists such as Jedi Mind Tricks (landing two guest spots on the now classic, \"Violent By Design\") as well as others. In early 2000, Louis released his first album, \"Music To Drink By\", largely composed of his 12 inch releases. His album garnered mild fanfare but his off-kilter flow and dynamics left him with a small fanbase. \n\nFrustrated, Louis Logic went back to the boards and started remodeling his lyrical style in favor of more complex multisyllable rhyme structure and darker humor, and lost some of his \"underground\" curtails. During this period Louis\'s releases became more sparse but cropped up lesser 12 inch releases such as in 2002 Cage & Copywrite b/w Louis Logic b/w Vakill & Juice - \'With Us b/w Resume b/w Urban Legend\'. Meanwhile Louis\'s peer group changed slightly, instead of Vinnie Paz and the Jedi Mind Trick family Louis expanded to Celph Tilted, Majik Most and most importantly JJ Brown, a young up and coming producer with an ear for cheeky yet complex melodies more suited for Louis\'s new found humor. \n\nIn 2003, Louis Logic released Sin-A-Matic, which gained extremely high praise, and even as recently as March 2006 on Artofrhyme.com was refered to as \"maybe the best independent Hip Hop album in recent memory\" as well as earning him #10 on the top 15 albums of 2003 at Rapreviews.com.  \n\nHis new found style drew many comparisons to Eminem because of his rhyme structure and more notably his topics such as joking about abusing women, murder and among other inappropriate things. While Louis vocally sounds little like Marshall, Louis has always shown an affinity for Em\'s lyrical deterxity quoting him \"No need for alarm, just remain calm\" on Postal and even early in his career as \"I used to be a loudmouth\". The immediate comparison turns off some hip hoppers including his sometimes rap partner Apathy who surprised artofrhyme interviewer with his neglect to mention him in in an interview until asked about him. \"Louis...I don\'t have anything to do with Louis. He was always more Celph\'s friend, I never rocked that tight with him. He was cool at first because he was more of a hip-hop MC. Then he started to get a little funny throughout the years.\"  \n\nAside from comparisons, Louis Logic\'s complex witty lyrical flow has been the subject for internet message board arguments with fans often listing him as one of hip hop\'s best, sellout, stupid, genious and everything in-between. Louis even took time to mock the fickleness of hip hop fans who often are guilty of the \"indier than thou\" and too quick to assign labels to their music with Fair Weather Fan, as one of the unfortunate downsides of success in an indie market comes a level of increased critism.  Louis also mixes politics in music and most surprisingly shows a very high aptitude for relationships from a male persceptive with his Idiot Gear.\n\nDespite Louis\'s success on Sin-A-Matic, he mentioned that he couldn\'t make another album only to have it ignored by more major publications.\n\nLouis Logic in 2004 released along with partner in rhyme/sound-a-like Jay Love, \"Odd Couple\" which had mixed reviews. \n\nIn December 2005, Louis got his break landing a record deal with Fat Beats along with JJ Brown for \"Misery Loves Comedy\" which was completed on February 10th and released June 13, 2006. Misery Loves Comedy made the rounds for reviews to a much wider audience as PopMatters, IGN, Okayplayer, HipHopDX, MVRemix and All Music Guide unlike his previous solo LPs, partly due to his new label and his previous Sin-A-Matic.  \n\nSonically JJ and Louis abandoned previous hip hopisms to make way for a cross over sound geared to fit topics of relationships, friends and drinking as opposed to battle raps and political statements that filled Sin-A-Matic; reflecting his departure with the Demigodz and newfound friendship with Travis from Gym Class Heroes.  The album received mostly positive reviews, but failed to live up to Sin-A-Matic as many reviewers cited JJ Brown\'s production as the weakest link. \n\nPost Misery Loves Comedy, Louis Logic has been working co-writing JJ Brown on his first solo LP to which Louis professes \"You guys will be surprised how much J. has learned about rapping in the last 6 months. The kid could outshine most of the guys making records that I hear.

One of nine children to his mother \"Miss Ivy\" and father, owner of a small sound system, Rodney first picked up the mic as a deejay at nine years old.\nHe nearly lost his life to gun violence at 14, but thankfully fully recovered from the bystander assault and soon began his music career as Bounty Hunter. He joined neighborhood friends Nitty Kutchie and Boom Dandemite in seeking out opportunities in country as well as town, performing for Metromedia and Bodyguard, as well as other local area sound systems. It was during a chance meeting with brother of King Jammy, Uncle T, which would change his career forever.\n\nBounty\'s initial recordings were done by Uncle T, after Jammy himself was skeptical due to the violent nature of the tracks. Jammy eventually relented upon witnessing the rising popularity of the deejay.\nHis first hit record on the sound system circuit was Dub Fi Dub and other recordings with the King Jammys label were compiled into 1993\'s Jamaica\'s Most Wanted, later released as Roots, Reality and Culture. By 1993, now known internationally as Bounty Killer, Rodney was quickly becoming regarded as one of the fiercest and most lyrically gifted of the next generation of deejays. Hits such as Coppershot, Lodge, and Spy Fi Die quickly propelled Bounty to an upper-echelon deejay, and sound system dubplate favorite. \"Coppershot\" was actually a hit in New York before Jamaica, which left Bounty as personally indebted to the American city as much as his native Kingston. 1993 also brought the beginning of a long, on-and-off rivalry with Beenie Man, which culminated in a battle at Sting 1993, extended through the mid-90s and flared up again in the latter half of the following decade.\n\nBounty won the war at Sting 1993 and his legacy as dancehall superstar was cemented as a result. The mid-1990s brought hit after hit, such as Cellular Phone, Not Another Word, and Mama. The heated war-of-words with Beenie Man gave the world many popular tunes from each side, including Ask Fi War, Suspense, and War Beyond The Stars. \n\nThe mid-90s era culminated in the release of My Xperience in 1996. The most comercially successful album of Bounty\'s career, and widely considered one of the best dancehall albums of the decade, it mixed popular dancehall tracks, such as Living Dangerously featuring Barrington Levy and Fed Up, with hip-hop crossover duets featuring Jeru The Damaja, Raekwon and, most popularly, The Fugees.\nThe decade closed out with two more albums, Next Millenium, which featued more hip-hop guest combinations, and 5th Element, which returned to a more hardcore-dancehall style.\n\nBy the year 2000, Bounty Killer, along with Capleton, was still considered the top deejay in the business, particularly with the waning popularity (at the time) of Beenie Man, and refocused career path of Buju Banton. This was due as much to being the most in-demand artist for dubplate recordings by sound systems as to actual studio material.\nIn 2001, he was featured with No Doubt on their international hit Hey Baby, and appeared with the band for a pre-game performance at the 2002 NFL Super Bowl.\nIn 2002, Bounty released his most ambitious project since My Xperience, a double CD (released seperately), titled Ghetto Dictionary: The Mystery and Ghetto Dictionary: The Art of War. While not nearly the commercial success of My Xperience, underground sales were strong, and it featured the smash dancehall hit Sufferah.\n\nSince the Ghetto Dictionary project, Bounty Killer\'s influence has mostly been behind-the-scenes, working with young talent and bringing new dancehall reggae stars to the forefront. He has been credited with bolstering the careers of, among others, Elephant Man, Busy Signal, Wayne Marshall, Baby Cham, and Vybz Kartel.\nHe currently oversees a stable of artists known alternately as The Alliance and Gully, which includes Mavado and Aidonia.',199351,1385918),(232,'Quanie Cash','',405,1686),(233,'Crown City Rockers','Comprised of the Cali bred MC Raashan Ahmad, producer Woodstock, the Berklee trained keyboardist Kat Ouano, bassist/producer Headnodic, and drummer Max MacVeety, Crown City Rockers formed in Beantown’s Roxbury section during the late nineties.\n\nRaashan, who\'d moved from Pasadena at the time to pursue his dreams of emceeing ran into the Berklee contingent at various open-mic and freestyle sessions aroung the city (Kat hails originally from Wichita, Kansas, Headnodic from Wisconsin, and Max is from Massachusetts). Everyone clicked, sharing an interest in organic hip-hop and live instrumentation, bonding musically as well as personally. \n\n\"We did some shows in Boston trying to get our name out,\" recounts Raashan. \"And then we decided to move out to Cali to record an album.\" \n\nAnd so, the group, then known as Mission: which at that time included Moe Pope (check Project Move), set out West. The trip to Cali proved to be an adventure in itself. An 18-wheeler totaled all of the group\'s instruments and the car they were driving. Once the group finally made it out west, they used the insurance money from the accident to put out a self-titled EP to get their name out. \n\nSoon after came their first full-length, called One. The album quickly established the group as subterranean scene stalwarts in the Bay Area hip hop community, where they were now located. After that, the group, who in 2003 changed their name to Crown City Rockers after Mission UK, (a British goth dance rock band) asked them to switch monikers, hit the studio hard recording countless songs, eventually placing 19 on their 2004 debut, Earthtones. \n\nThe group are currently (mid-2008) working on their third album.',54271,604662),(234,'Piccalo','Piccalo is a duo that represents overtown, Miami.

Tippa toured extensively with his friend and long-time sparring partner, Pato Banton, throughout the Eighties including an appearance at Jamaica\'s Reggae Sunsplash and their U.S. debut tours together. The U.K. DJ duo of Tippa Irie and Pato Banton had become one of the genres favourite combinations. As the Nineties began, the dynamic duo pursued their solo careers. Over a decade would pass before Tippa & Pato would reunite in the studio with legendary singing sensation Peter Spence to produce \"The Good Old Days\"--a track featured on Pato\'s 2000 Grammy-nominated \'Life is a Miracle\' and Tippa\'s \'I Miss\' tribute album to his late and <br>great sister/MC Miss Irie.\n\nTippa Irie has produced fifteen albums to date and has a string of ..1 hit <br>songs to his credit including \"Hello Darling\", \"Raggamuffin Girl\" (featuring Peter Hunnigale), \"Stress\" (featuring Lloyd Brown), \"Superwoman\" (featuring Winsome), \"Baby I\'ve Been Missing You\" (featuring Janet Lee Davis) and \"Shouting for the Gunners\"--a song originally recorded for the Arsenal Football Team which reached the Top 30 status on the British pop charts. Tippa\'s first album-\'Is It Really Happening To Me\' (1986), was followed by \'Two Sides of Tippa Irie\' (1987). Soon thereafter \'JA To UK Clash\' (1988) with Papa San was released for Fashion Records. Then came \'Original Raggamuffin\' (1989) and \'New Decade\' (1990), both for Island Records.

Tippa\'s latest offering is entitled \'Greatest Hits\'(2005) on Sanctuary Records and it features six of his ..1 hit songs as well as many of his classic signature tunes.\n\nTo this day, Tippa Irie remains one of the most requested Reggae entertainers internationally. The surviving members of Sublime made sure their Long Beach Dub All Stars debut for Dreamworks Records had the necessary dancehall credentials by commissioning Tippa Irie to contribute \"Sensi\" on their \'Right Back\'(1999) CD and be their special guest on their subsequent North American tour. In 2000 he was invited to \nsupport UB40 on their sold-out Labour of Love III UK tour. Later Tippa was called back in the studio with Long Beach Dub All Stars to record \"Life Goes On\" featuring Half Pint and Jurassic Five\'s Charli2na on LBDA\'s \'Wonders of the World\'(2001) CD for Dreamworks Records. Impressed with Tippa\'s rapid-fire lyrical arsensal, Jurassic Five asked Tippa to record together and the end result was a wicked Tippa and Charli2na combination entitled \"The Struggle\". The rap world took notice and soon enough Tippa was once again summoned to record with some of the music industry\'s biggest stars.

With the success of their eponymous debut recording, Point Blank had a reasonable amount of momentum heading into the studio to record Second Season. But rather than rearrange or pepper things up a bit in the recording process, Point Blank pretty much stayed the same as they did for their first record: a five-piece (they ditched the keyboardist) writing songs around crunchy blues guitar riffs that resemble a hybrid of British hard rock (Zeppelin, Deep Purple) and Southern rock. As a result, there really isn\'t much improvement over the first album (save for the removal of the cheesy, pun-infected cover art, replaced by the lads in the band \"taking it easy\" in the backyard, complete with yellow sunlit soft-focus photography).

With strong air-play on AOR radio stations the track reached #20 on Billboard Magazine\'s Rock Tracks chart. Subsequently, Nicole was also released as a 45 RPM single and peaked inside the Top 40 at #39 on Billboard\'s Hot 100. While other songs received airplay and charted, this was the only time Point Blank placed a record inside the top 40, and thus the band are remembered by some as a one-hit wonder.\n\n2) Point Blank \"The Bull\", a Houston, TX based rapper who is a member of the South Park Coalition (S.P.C.) and Wreckless Klan.

Everyone was playing hardcore, and so were we. But soon we’ve realized that simply hardcore was not us, although we liked the energy that playing hardcore produces. So our music started to change. No one was talking about changes but our telepathy worked. We started to make more complex and more melodic rock/metal songs, and the atmosphere in the band changed. Everybody started to behave more serious and more dedicated. We simply wanted to sound modern. At that point we’ve realized that POINT BLANK was no more some adolescent joke. Everyone in the band had experience with other bands before we started playing, but nothing like this. This was it. When we started playing, we were like 2 and a half years locked up in our garage making music and searching for our own sound. We simply wanted to be ready before our first performance. We were, and still are convinced that live acts are the most important thing that builds the band character, despite the recording sessions. So the time for our first gig came…Our first gig went the way every new band wanted, crowded, claustrophobic, and very hot. It all started after that… Recording studios, radio and TV shows, Festivals, Tours… The band members are: Blagoja Gigov – Guitar Metodija Atanasovski – Guitar Damjan Mitrevski – Vocals Dimitri Trickovski – Bass Vladimir Mitrevski – Drums All five of us are together in the band since day one. We don’t have changes in the band and we don’t plan to do that because we’re great together…We understand and respect each other very much, and besides that, we’re friends like a 100 years. So that`s our short story. We hope we didn`t\n\n4)One of Canada\'s most recognized groups in hip-hop, Point Blank  continue to make long strides in the music industry. Comprised of 6 emcees and one in house producer - Imperial, Trouble, Stump, Kidd, RPD, Jackal  and Pikihed - share a common goal and vision to be the voice of youth growing up in the inner city.   All members were raised in Toronto, Ontario\'s infamous Regent Park  - North America\'s Oldest Social Housing Project.   Their recordings are a reflection of their experiences growing up in the impoverished neighborhood.   As artists, they all have distinctive lyrical styles and deliveries reminiscent of classic hip-hop groups like Wu-Tang & Boot Camp.   As a group, PB has performed alongside hip-hop legends such as Rakim , KRS-1 , Outkast and Mobb Deep .   Their national success has allowed them to travel across the country and build a solid fan base of listeners and supporters.  \n\nRunning as a crew since 1989, the members\' first united in elementary school and formed a group called Poetic Vandals .

Their lyrics speak of racial profiling, single parent households, poverty, community programs, crime, drug addiction, crooked politicians, police and other social issues surrounding youth growing up in government housing.  \n\nMembers Trouble, Stump & Kidd are all brothers and Pikihed & RPD are also identical twins.   These family ties have instilled a strong sense of family values and loyalty within the group.    It has also bred a strong desire to see their families enjoy better living conditions and prosper .  \n\nIn 1996 Point Blank released \" Retaliation \" on DJ X\'s Power Move Show (CKLN 88.1FM) Demo Battle, and received their first public appraisal. Shortly after, they were featured on Muchmusic\'s \"Soul in The city\" program.

Point Blank moved to Atlanta, where they resided with Andre Rison and the late Left Eye Lopez the group recorded several singles and shared stages with remarkable groups like Outcast. In 1997 Point Blank dropped the 12\'\' single \" Startin Shit/ 3 Man Weave \" . Before long they were featured in The Source Magazine , representing music splurging from the city of Toronto. In 2000 Tilt Rock Records dropped Point Blank Underground - a compilation of 16 tracks from previous work, which sold roughly 5000 units.   The release was followed by the single \" Thin Line . \" The track grew to befall one of the most requested Canadian tracks in record pools all across Canada and charted on Flow 93.5\'s Battle of the Beats for a myriad of weeks. Success surrounded the group as they started getting features on main TV and Radio shows and appearing on publications such as Peace, Pound, Now Magazine as well as Toronto Star and The Sun . In 2003 Ed The Sock from Much Music visited Regent Park, giving the group a chance to speak in behalf of the neighborhood. Shortly after, Point Blank were invited to perform live on Much Music for Ed\'s big Wham Bam, as well as host Rapcity, where their video \" Want It Wit Us ,\" had reached the top 5 chart on MuchMusic\'s Rapcity.  \n\n5) An Oi! band from Beijing China.\nChen Hao (China) - Guitar\nJosh (USA) - Guitar/Vocals\nWang Yun Hui (China) - Bass\nThomas (France) - Vocals\nNew Drummer soon \n\n6) Point Blank is an alias of techno producer Jeroen Verheij.

He had made a collab with the famous rapper Zico back in 2008, the track can be found on many platforms including YouTube and SoundCloud.\n\nIn early 2015, RM earned not only the approval from big names in the Korean Hip-hop scene, but he had also gained respect from the American Hip-hop figure Warren G. The two came together for the track \"P.D.D\", where RM asks his haters to stay alive to witness his success. The west coast rapper stated in an interview with CJ America, \"I couldn’t understand all his lyrics, but I can say that it was very good because his flow, style, and rhythm are all excellent.” He then even went on to say, \"When I hear Rap Monster’s songs, it sounds like Snoop Dogg or me rapping with the beats we’ve made.” \n\n On March 4, 2015, RM released a single with Warren G entitled, \"P.D.D (Please Don\'t Die)\" ahead of his first solo mixtape RM following an offer by Warren G to collaborate. The track reflected how RM felt towards those who hated and criticized him at the time, which he used to find very upsetting.\n\nThat same March, RM collaborated with hip hop project group MFBTY, EE and Dino J on the song \"Bucku Bucku\".

The two conversed through lyrics, claiming that people were controlled by the higher power and voiced out their wish of a changing world.\n\nIn 2018, he came out with a second mixtape named \"mono\". A project containing a few collaborations (with artists such as HONNE, NELL, eAeon) where Nam-joon experimented with lofi Hip-Hop and ballad. Though different from his previous works, he was still able to showcase his soul-deep lyricism, where he often implemented his skill of using wordplay and metaphors to further reach his listeners. With this mixtape, he continued to explore his own identity and life through a microscope, touching topics like loneliness, self-doubt, longing, and even explored the concept of love and hate. \'mono\' proved RM a unique artist of diversity and growth.

In two months Elymas (keyboards), who added wishful atmosphere, joined the band.\n\nThe debut Drama\'s album \"Silver Brilliance Of Nocticula\" was recorded shortly after demo tape Wintercrown\" in 2003. A short time later Elymas left the band because of a fatal accident. As a result of making a contract with Black Side Productions (Saint-Petersburg) \"Silver Brilliance Of Nocticula\" was released as MC (1000 copies) in December, 2003. Then Drama started working on the stuff for the next album.\n\nIn February, 2004 Drama came to Kazan for recording the second album Winds Choir Opera\".

His music is described as purely Southern-fried sound, with hyperkinetic beats, operatic electronica backing, and lyrical flows in which every breath seems destined to be his last.   Drama\'s impassioned, gruff growl lies somewhere between Ja Rule\'s and that of most of the No Limits posse. His song, \"Left, Right, Left\" was a club and radio hit.\n\n4. Drama, a progressive rock band from france.   In their beginnings they tried unsuccessfully to re-create the spirit of the 70’s but without inspiration is not much what you can accomplish but they improved with the pass f the years..   The band was formed in the mid 90’s in Rouen - France and in 1995 they release their first self titled album with Eric Azhar in the guitars, Jean-François Duboc playing bass, Laurent Guilhot the drummer, Richard Langlois in the keys and Jean-Marc Leclerc adds additional percussion, in track four.\n\nThere are a few things this guys should know, not everybody is able to play in the Genesis style and be successful, good instrumental debut but still it was evident something was missing and IMO it was ambition.  For their second release “Flying through the 21st Century” (1998), Jean-Marc Leclerc and Richard Langlois leave the band so Eric Azhar takes the keyboards and they recruit a vocalist named Louis de Fusco. In the first album the main problem is the lack of ambition, well they went to the other extreme, still keeping the main Genesis influence, they add ethnic influences from Africa, Asia and even the opener named “La Magna Carta” with bagpipes, maybe they should stick to one sound and stop wandering, but still musically is a big evolution.  Now the problem is the high pitched vocalist de Fusco, they should have remained as an instrumental band, the guy really wasn’t in the level for the band, the consequence was evident, the critics were devastating but they keep going.  In the year 2000 DRAMA was invited to Baja Prog where along with AFTER CRYING, ECLAT, ISILDURS BANE and PALLAS received the bet critics, surely their sound was already improving more.  In the year 2005, DRAMA surprises us with a their album called “Stigmata of Changes” with a completely different lineup formed by Azhar (Who claims back the guitar) and Duboc from the original formation plus a new keyboardist Ralph Adam and of course a new vocalist named Yvon Lucas.  The change is for good, Lucas is far better than his predecessor, his voice is soft and gentle but serves perfectly for their new material and Adam’s keyboards are pretty decent, heavily influenced by Genesis and Pink Floyd again with some bluesy and Folk influences.  This album is pretty good and makes us believe they can keep improving as they done through their career, hope this time we won’t have to wait 7 years for a new release\n\n5. a Norwegian pop band from Larvik. They became a sensation when debuting on national television with the song \"Daydreamer (Breaking Away)\" as teenagers.\n\n6. Drama was a very short-lived progressive rock band from The Netherlands (1971-1973), which was a bit of a \'supergroup\' of sorts.

After 8 months, Goran - guitar, joined the band and the band continued to evolve in new directions. After his arrival, the band continued working on their songs with more passion and creativity.

In reggae, we were blessed with the maniacal genius of Lee Perry; in jazz, we had Sun Ra; and in hip-hop no one even comes close to the one they call Sensational (Born; Colin Julius Bobb on October 18, 1974.)\n\nHip-hop abounds with eccentric personalities such as Kool Keith, Old Dirty Bastard (R.I.P.), and Busta Rhymes, but Sensational trumps even these colorful MCs with an abstract flavor and a charm all his own. Born into the world of beats as Torture, a name perfectly befitting his dusted productions and not-ready-for-prime-time style, Sens linked up with the world-famous Jungle Brothers when he was only 15. Starting off as a back-up dancer , he went on to prove his mettle on the mic, rhyming to records by the German avant-garde electronic composer, Stockhausen. In fact, Torture\'s legendary performances on the Jungle Brothers\' album JBeez Wit Da Remedy (Warner Bros., 1994), on which he rhymes at 180 beats per minute, are still way ahead of their time. (They may be heard on the Black Hoodz release, Crazy Wisdom Masters (BH006)).\n\nIn 1995, Torture came to the attention of WordSound through producer Bill Laswell, who had worked on the Jungle Brothers sessions. It was a match made in heaven as Torture changed his name to Sensational and released his solo debut, Loaded With Power (WSCD022), an album like no other in the annals of hip-hop. CMJ called it, \"The most bold and experimental hip-hop record of the last decade,\" but even this is an understatement. The tripped-out flows, broken beats, and lo-fi ambience all created an epic event in hip-hop that went largely unnoticed by the Puff Daddy-worshipping masses. And to think, it was all created by one man with a four-track, drum machine, and, of course, headphones used as a mic.\n\nUnlike most rap producers, Sensational has never been one to sample, but plays all his sounds live. Upgrading to an 8-track for his sophomore effort, Corner The Market (WSCD032), gave the rapper/producer greater flexibility in recording. He also used a real microphone this time around instead of recording vocals through his headphones. Still wowing heads with his blunted, poetry-in-motion sickness, he released two singles for the popular indie rock label Matador (\"Party Jumpin\" and \"Beats, Rhymes & Styles\") before dropping his third full-length, Heavyweighter (WSCD037) which continues on a trajectory for outer space. As Timeout NY noted, Sensational is \"underground hip-hop\'s number one upstart-in-waiting.\" Sensational\'s unique style and personality have been showcased in the semi-biographical film Crooked (WSCD041), released by WordSound in 2001. The film, which documents the underground hip-hop scene in Brooklyn in the \'90s, became an instant cult classic and is available on DVD along with its companion soundtrack, produced largely by Sensational.\n\nDuring the filming of Crooked, Sensational recorded Get on My Page for Mike Patton\'s Ipecac label, before returning to WordSound for his fifth release, Natural Shine (WSCD044), produced and recorded by DJ KLOS. KLOS also produced the follow-up, Speaks For Itself, available on Belgium\'s Quatermass label, as well as the new mixtape, The Best of Sensational (WSDD002) available as a download only on WordSound Digital. Sensational\'s latest CD, Sensational Meets Kouhei (WSCD53), is a collaboration with Japan\'s doyen of noisecore, Kouhei Matsunaga, recorded in one day in Osaka, Japan while on tour in 2005.',10471,185254),(261,'Rey Pirin','',9367,43977),(262,'L\'Skadrille','L’équipe se compose de 13or et 16ar. 13or alias la massue est originaire de Saint-Cyr, Yvelines. 16ar alias la lame vient de Meudon, Hauts de Seine.

The name of the band references the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh who allegedly cut off his own ear. It was formed in Spain in 1996, when guitarist Pablo Benegas, bassist Álvaro Fuentes, keyboardist Xabi San Martín and drummer Haritz Garde met at university.\n\nSan Martin was the vocalist until Amaia Montero joined the band by request from Benegas, just after he met her at a dinner party. Much later, the band played at El Concurso de Pop/Rock de San Sebastián, at which they were discovered and later signed by Sony Music.\n\nTheir first album, Dile al Sol (Tell The Sun), debuted in 1998; it went to the top of the Spanish music charts, and won the Premio Ondas to The very best Album of the Year. After numerous tours, the group released two more albums, El Viaje de Copperpot (Copperpot\'s Journey) and Lo que te Conté Mientras te Hacias la Dormida (What I Told You While You Pretended To Be Asleep) as well as two DVDs: La Oreja De Van Gogh with material from their first two records, and a live performance called Lo que te Conté Mientras te Hacias la Dormida Gira 2003\'.\n\nTheir songs are written (both lyrics and music) mostly by Xabi San Martín and Amaia Montero in collaboration with Pablo Benegas, and the themes are usually love, friendship, or whatever comes up in a relationship between two people.\n\nTheir fourth album, Guapa, was released April 25th 2006.

A songs craftsman, as he likes to consider himself.\n\nBorn Aug 22, 1961 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he began his professional musical career at the age of 17 playing keyboards in Raíces.\nIn 1981 he incorporated to one of the main bands of the Argentinean \'80s rock scene: Los Abuelos de la Nada. Although the band was led by the brilliant Miguel Abuelo, Calamaro composed most of the band\'s hits, like \"Mil Horas,\" \"Así es el calor,\" \"Sin gamulán\" and \"Costumbres Argentinas.\"\n\nIn 1984 he made his solo debut with Hotel Calamaro. The album was a bizarre mix of styles and musicians, and didn\'t gain public or press support.\n\nIn 1985 he left Los Abuelos de la Nada and registered his second album Vida Cruel. Inspite of the important musicians and guests, such as Luis Alberto Spinetta and Charly García, the album was a disappointment: both commercially and artistically. But if as a songwriter the luck was out of reach, he had an intense and successful work as a producer of bands like Los Enanitos Verdes, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Don Cornelio y la zona. He also worked and collaborated with many artists of different styles and genres, a constant attitude through his whole career. The third album Por Mirarte showed Calamaro in a better shape with an established band. Released in 1988 it contains some outstanding songs such as \"Con los dientes apretados\" and \"Me olvidé de los demás,\" while others like \"Cartas sin Marcar\" and \"Loco por tí\" helped the album to get popular.\n\nWhen Calamaro released in 1989 Nadie Sale Vivo de Aquí, Argentina was living it\'s worst economical crisis: few albums were released. The album title suggest it all: Nobody comes out alive from here. The LP production was paralyzed, and the few that could make it were almost ignored. That was Calamaro\'s case. This situation lead the singer to settle in Spain, following a road taken by many Argentinean rockers. Out there in Spain he met Ariel Rot y Javier Infante, former members of Tequila. They formed Los Rodríguez in 1991, a pop-rock band that was very popular in Spain and Latin America: Calamaro\'s songs began to be popular like in the early \'80s: the hit maker was on the road again. Curiously, from Spain, he was conquering Argentina. While being part of the band he didn\'t release any new solo material, just Grabaciones Encontradas 1 y 2, a couple of CDs that contained unreleased and rare material from the \'80s. \n\nAfter the split of Los Rodríguez, Calamaro returned to his solo career recording Alta Suciedad in 1997, an album produced by Joe Blaney. This album brought him the commercial success that seemed to fail in his previous solo efforts, and sold 300.000 copies just in Argentina. That is certainly a huge amount for the country\'s small market. No doubts, that album helped him to be placed between the star legends of the national rock scene. Before that album Calamaro was considered an important character, appreciated by other musicians, but not a main one. After he broke up with his spanish girlfriend he released in 1999 the double CD Honestidad Brutal. Recorded when he was 37, it contained 37 songs of despair, love loss, drugs and regret. It was not as successful at the previous album, but showed a new Calamaro: desperate, decadent and often elegant at the same time, with a new and raw lyrical approach. El Salmon followed in spring 2001.\nCalamaro\'s next proyect, El Cantante, was released in 2005. A delicious mixture of tango, rock n\'roll and flamenco guitars (mostly played by spanish prodigy El Niño Josele).\nAfter a break, he returned to the stages with a tour full of classics that gave birth to a live album called El Regreso on 2005, recorded with members of Bersuit Vergarabat as a backing band. This album was very well received for the charts as well as for the critics, wich lead him to different awards. One year later, on 2006, Andres published a new album from the roots of tango with the collaboration of guitarrists Niño Josele and Juanjo Dominguez. On 2007 El palacio de las flores was published, although it was recorded on 2006. The album had the collaboration and musical influence of argentine composer Lito Nebbia and was also recorded on his studio.

Their whimsical lyrics and naïve musical approach made them stand out among the low-brow indie crowd.

He is identified primarily with salsa romantica or \"salsa monga\", but has also experimented with styles ranging from Colombian vallenato to urban reggaeton. Unlike other young salsa performers such as Marc Anthony, he has neither recorded in English, nor made a Latin pop album, nor (with rare exceptions) ventured into acting, preferring to remain a musician grounded within salsa music.\n\nAlthough born in New York, Víctor was raised primarily in Añasco and Isabela, Puerto Rico. Growing up in Puerto Rico had a great impact on his youth as he enjoyed salsa music (which was immensely popular in Puerto Rico at the time). His singing career began by chance, during a concert at his high school\'s graduation party by salsa superstar Gilberto Santa Rosa. At the instigation of classmates, who were going on about their friend the sonero, Santa Rosa invited Víctor to jump up on stage and sing a song with him. To Santa Rosa\'s surprise, not only could Victor sing, but he \"free-styled\" the improvisational soneo lyrics in the song, and traded soneos with Santa Rosa. Shortly thereafter, on Santa Rosa\'s recommendation, Puerto Rican bandleader Don Periñon hired teenage Victor as a backup singer. During these years of apprenticeship he performed with numerous salsa greats.\n\nThanks again to Santa Rosa, Manuelle was eventually signed as a solo artist to Sony Tropical.

Phương Dung also has the title of \"The Gò Công White Swallow\" by Hà Huy Hà, a poet known as Kiên Giang, gave her.\n\nPhương Dung\'s hometown is in Tiền Giang and was a student of Gia Long school. She started her singing career around 1960, at the age of 12. She rose to fame at the age of 17 after successfully presenting the song \"Nỗi buồn gác trọ\", of Hoai Linh and Manh Phat in 1962, then being more famous for songs like \"The Sim flower hill\" in 1964 (by Dzũng Chinh, Hữu Loan\'s poem) and \"Tạ từ trong đêm\" in 1965 (by Trần Thiện Thanh). Phương Dung was awarded the gold medal for the \"Singer of the Year\" in 1965, while the author Trần Thiện Thanh received the \"Best Song of the Year\".\n\nShe recorded a lot of EPs for Vietnamese companies: Sóng Nhạc, Sơn Ca, and then the Akai tape for centres of Continental, Trường Hải, Nhật Trường and was a huge success. When it comes to the song: \"The Sim flower hill\" (Dzũng Chinh and Hữu Loan), \"Nỗi buồn gác trọ\" (Mạnh Phát and Hoài Linh), \"Tạ từ trong đêm\" (Trần Thiện Thanh), \"Khúc hát ân tình\" (Xuân Tiên và Y Vân), \"Đố ai\" (Phạm Duy), \"Sương lạnh chiều đông\" (Mạnh Phát), \"Tím cả rừng chiều\" (Thu Hồ), \"Vọng gác đêm sương\" (Mạnh Phát), \"Cánh buồm chuyển bến\" (Minh Kỳ), \"Nỗi buồn đêm đông\" (Anh Minh), \"Sắc hoa màu nhớ\" (Nguyễn Văn Đông), \"Biết đâu tìm\" (Hoàng Thi Thơ), \"Còn mãi những khúc tình ca\" (Quốc Dũng)... it is difficult to deny Phương Dung was singing love songs associated with the wartime.\n\nIn 1968, she married and gave up her music career for motherhood, having 8 children, 6 boys and 2 girls. In 1977 the family moved to Australia and her 2 daughters followed in her footsteps - Phuong Vy had worked with the Thúy Nga Center (as well as movies like Romper Stomper) and Hoang Ly with Asia Entertainment before becoming a model.\n\nIn recent years, she returned to Vietnam and is embraced with music lovers. In 2014, Phương Dung joined with Giao Linh to perform concerts Sol Golden, anniversary of her musical path for years. In the same year Phương Dung was invited as judge for the music competition \"Solo cùng Bolero\" and has continued on the talent show into 2016.\n\nNếu kể đến những giọng ca được coi là huyền thoại đã đi vào lịch sử tân nhạc Việt Nam thì chắc chắn Phương Dung không thể nằm ngoài danh sách này. Chất giọng cao và lảnh lót của chị đã chính thức đến với người nghe từ cuối thập niên 50, khi còn là một thiếu nhi 13, 14 tuổi. Giọng ca đó càng ngày càng gây nhiều chú ý trong bối cảnh của cuộc chiến tranh với những nhạc phẩm mang nội dung thật gần gũi với tình yêu trong thời chinh chiến hoặc với những nét đẹp của quê hương. Những yếu tố đó đã mang đến cho Phương Dung một sự thành công thật lớn để chị có thể hãnh diện về sự đóng góp của mình cho nền tân nhạc Việt Nam. Sau khi xuất hiện không bao lâu, Phương Dung đã được báo chí và những người ái mộ tặng cho danh hiệu \"Con Nhạn Trắng Gò Công\", bắt nguồn từ thành phố nơi chị sinh trưởng ở vùng Tiền Giang vào năm 1945…\n\nGia đình Phương Dung là một gia đình khá giả ở Gò Công, có vườn tược, hoa mầu cùng cửa hàng buôn bán như chị cho biết. Song thân chị có tất cả 4 người con. Ngoài Phương Dung, là một người con gái lớn và 2 người con trai. Cả hai người sau đều gia nhập binh chủng Nhảy Dù, trong số có một người tử trận tại Cổ Thành Quảng Trị vào mùa hè năm 72. Trưởng thành trong một hoàn cảnh thoải mái về vật chất, người con thứ hai trong gia đình với một người mẹ là em vợ nhà văn nổi tiếng Hồ Biểu Chánh, rất yêu thích văn chương.\n\nThân phụ Phương Dung là người xuất gia một thời gian từ khi còn trẻ. Tuy nhiên sự xuất gia này được chị giải thích là chỉ gieo duyên chứ không đi hẳn vào vào con đường tu hành . Điều này có nghĩa sau thời gian gieo duyên vài năm, ông trở về coi sóc vườn tược của gia đình. Riêng về việc Phương Dung muốn ca hát, ông tỏ ra rất ủng hộ chị trên con đường nghệ thuật. \"Ông nói rằng đi hát là một cái nghề rất là lương thiện mà tự vì người dân của mình họ bảo thủ và có một cái nhìn sai lạc về những người làm nghệ thuật nói chung. Nhưng mà con đi hát thì phải biết mình là người yêu nghệ thuật mà đi hát chứ không phải sống một cuộc sống bừa bãi . Tự vì người nghệ sĩ mà không làm nghệ thuật giỏi và hay thì người ta đâu có thích. Và nếu nói theo Phật pháp người mà được người ta thương mến nhiều là người có tu nhiều kiếp lắm\", đó là nguyên văn lời Phương Dung kể về ông bố của mình đối với nghiệp cầm ca.\n\nTuy song thân Phương Dung sống theo lối cổ, mang nhiều ảnh hưởng của Nho học và thích thơ phú. Nhưng cả hai đều có đầu óc rất cởi mở.. Có thể vì vậy Phương Dung ít ra cũng mang chút ảnh hưởng về nghệ thuật, về sự phóng khoáng trong tâm hồn khi tỏ ra rất thích đọc sách về thơ văn để hết lòng ngưỡng mộ nhà văn Nguyễn Tuân và say mê những tác phẩm của nhóm Tự Lực Văn Đoàn. Ngoài ra chị cũng rất thích những sáng tác thuộc loại văn chương \"miệt vườn\" của Hồ Biểu Chánh, Sơn Nam hay Nguyễn Văn Ba, vv…Trong lần tâm sự với người viết, Phương Dung cho biết nếu được đi lại từ đầu, chị vẫn thích theo đuổi con đường nghệ thuật. Nếu không thành ca sĩ cũng sẽ thành một nhạc sĩ hoặc một nhà văn hay một nhà đạo diễn điện ảnh. Lý do dễ hiểu là chị là một con người mang một tâm hồn rất nhậy cảm nên dễ xúc động, chẳng hạn như trước những vần thơ hay mà chị thuộc nằm lòng. Phương Dung đã tỏ ra say sưa khi đề cập đến vấn đề này: \"là một người tình cảm thì phải nhiều chứ. Như vậy, mới hát đuợc, mới sống được với trái tim của người khác. Như vậy mới có thể rung động trước những câu thơ như.\"Ta đem trái đất ngâm thành rượu, ta lấy càn khôn biến thành môi…\"\n\nKhi còn theo học ở trường tiểu học nữ Gò Công, cô bé Phan Phương Dung nhiều tình cảm đã tỏ ra rất yêu thích ca hát và luôn có mặt trong các chương trình văn nghệ do trường tổ chức… Sau khi học hết bậc tiểu học, gia đình cho Phương Dung lên Sài Gòn thi vào lớp Đệ Thất trường trung học Gia Long niên khóa 1958 – 1959. Sau khi thi, dù lúc đó không nuôi mộng trở thành ca sĩ để sống mà chỉ thích được ca, được hát cho hay như chị nói. Nhưng Phương Dung cũng đã tự mình mò mẫm hỏi thăm đường đến tận đài phát thanh Sài Gòn sau khi biết được nơi đây sắp tổ chức một cuộc tuyển lựa ca sĩ. Sau này Phương Dung cũng không biết tại sao mình đã bạo dạn như vậy. Chắc chắn không có lý do nào khác hơn là niềm say mê ca hát. Thời gian này tân nhạc Việt Nam đã có nhiều ca sĩ nổi tiếng, đang cộng tác với đài phát thanh Sài Gòn như Thu Hương, Tâm Vấn, Thái Thanh, Thanh Thúy, Lệ Thanh, Bạch Yến, Bích Chiêu, vv…Đó là những khuôn mặt chị nhìn thấy vào đài phát thanh một cách dễ dàng lúc đứng ngòai cổng nhìn vào. Trong khi \"tôi đứng ở ngoài thì ông gác-dan ra hỏi: này cô bé làm gì mà cứ thập thò ngoaì này hoài vậy.\" \"Thưa con muốn vào để lấy đơn dự thi ca sĩ\". Ông biểu ngừng xe đạp đây vào trong phòng đó, để cái thẻ học sinh ở đây vào queo tay trái có ông nhạc sĩ nào đeo kính cận già già thì hỏi xin giấy tờ làm thủ tục dự thi ca sĩ\"\n\nCô bé tỉnh Gò Công mặc dù rất bỡ ngỡ, nhưng cũng theo lời chỉ dẫn của người gác dan vào gặp nhạc sĩ Võ Đức Tuyết. Khi Phương Dung cho biết ý định muốn dự thi hát của mình, chị đã được vị nhạc sư tên tuổi này đề nghị hát thử nhạc phẩm \"Em Bé Quê\" là bài Phương Dung sẽ dự thi. Nhờ đã quen đứng trước khán giả qua những buổi văn nghệ tại trường, Phương Dung đã không ngại ngùng gì đứng hát ngay giữa phòng, trước bao nhiêu người là những giọng ca nổi tiếng…\n\nNhưng may mắn chỉ đến với Phương Dung ở vòng sơ khảo và bán kết của cuộc tuyển lựa ca sĩ vào năm 58 của Đài Phát Thanh Sài Gòn. Vì \"vào chung kết thì Phương Dung rớt. Tại vì lúc mà cuối cùng họ đưa một cái bài bắt mình vừa phải vừa xướng thanh, vừa hát luôn, tất nhiên là mình phải biết rành về solfège mới làm được. Mấy người kia vì họ có đem theo đờn. Họ đờn, họ dượt nên họ hát hay. Còn mình hát thì có lỗi trong lúc mình xướng âm. Thành ra mình rớt.. Mình chỉ được đứng hạng 4\". Hai trong ba người được chấm đậu mà Phương Dung còn nhới là Nhật Thiên Lan và Thanh Sơn. Người sau trở thành một nhạc sĩ nổi tiếng sau đó và là tác giả của ca khúc từng một thời hầu như ai cũng biết tới là \"Nỗi Buồn Hoa Phương\"…\n\nTuy buồn vì không được lọt vào trong ba giải đầu, nhưng Phương Dung lại may mắn được giới thiệu với một nhạc sĩ nổi tiếng vào thời đó là Khánh Băng trong thời gian ông phụ trách chương trình văn nghệ cho giải trí trường Thị Nghè, là nơi xuất thân của không ít nghệ sĩ nổi tiếng. Vì số tuổi còn nhỏ nên chỉ quen mặc đầm, Phương Dung tỏ ra hơi ngượng ngập trong chiếc áo dài đầu đời khi xuất hiện lần đầu tên trên sân khấu giải trí trường Thị Nghè. Nhưng do mê hát nên cuối cùng cũng đã vượt qua được những ngượng ngùng, e thẹn lúc ban đầu để dần dần gây được chú ý bằng tiếng hát của mình. Chỉ trong vài năm đầu tiên đi hát, Phương Dung đã mau chóng gặp những cơ hội tiến thân tại những địa điểm trình diễn mà trước đó nhiều nghệ sĩ tên tuổi đã đi qua. Chẳng hạn như phòng trà Tứ Hải của ông Trần Cao Tăng, một thời là giám đốc đài phát thanh Pháp Á, là nơi Phương Dung hát \"lót đường\" vào năm 59 cho những giọng ca đã có tên tuổi mà Thanh Thuý là một trong số này. Năm sau, 1960, chị về hát ở phòng trà Anh Vũ là nơi trình diễn của rất nhiều nghệ sĩ như: Thanh Thuý, Khánh Ly, Trúc Mai, Bạch Yến, Bích Chiêu, Trần Văn Trạch, ban Tam Vân, Phương Lan, Quốc Thắng, v v…\n\nVào thời gian này, vì đi hát nhiều và nhất là chỉ chú tâm vào niềm đam mê ca nhạc nên Phương Dung đã không có được đủ điểm trong những kỳ thi tam cá nguyệt nên chỉ theo học trường Gia Long được đúng một niên khóa. Sau đó chị chuyển qua trường Đức Trí và học tại trường tư thục này đến hết lớp 11 rồi nghỉ học luôn. Song song trong thời kỳ đó, chị cũng đã theo học tại Hội Việt – Mỹ đến hết lớp 6.\n\nÍt ai còn nhớ và cũng không ngờ là thời kỳ hát ở Anh Vũ, Phương Dung lại là giọng ca chuyên trình bày những nhạc phẩm tiền chiến như Thiên Thai, Khối Tình Trương Chi, Trương Chi, Đàn Chim Việt, Suối Mơ, Buồn Tàn Thu, v v…Nguyên nhân là chị đã được hướng dẫn trong thời kỳ đầu bởi nhạc sĩ Lê Trung Quân (cũng đi hát dưới tên Vân Quang), cũng là một sĩ quan Không Quân là một người dạy chị hát theo giọng Bắc để trình bày những ca khúc tiền chiến. Cũng do đó, Phương Dung đã rất thích trước khi chuyển qua loại nhạc thời trang theo thị hiếu của khán thính giả và do các hãng đĩa nhạc yêu cầu, với các sáng tác của Lê Minh Bằng, Thanh Sơn, Châu Kỳ, vv…\n\nNhưng phải công nhận từ khi chuyển hẳn qua nhạc tình cảm phổ thông có tính cách đại chúng, Phương Dung đã mau chóng thành công và được biết tới nhiều với những ca khúc như : Chuyện Tình Lan Và Điệp, Hai Kỷ Niệm Một Chuyến Đi, Hoa Nở Về Đêm, Những Đồi Hoa Sim, v v… Với nhạc phẩm Đường Về Khuya của người nhạc sĩ cùng gốc Gò Công là Lê Dinh, Phương Dung lần đầu tiên thu thanh tiếng hát mình trên đĩa nhựa. Kế đó là những nhạc phẩm Vọng Gác Đêm Xuân, Hai Kỷ Niệm Một Chuyến Đi, vv…rất được khán thính giả ưa thích. Nhưng phải đợi đến năm 1962 khi nhạc phẩm Nỗi Buồn Gác Trọ ra đời thì tên tuổi Phương Dung thật sự đã bước vào một khúc quanh quan trọng, nhất là khi nhạc phẩm này được đưa vào phim \"Saigon By Night\" của hãng phim Alpha.\n\nTrước sự ăn khách của Phương Dung, hãng đĩa Sóng Nhạc của ông Lê Tất Oanh đã mời chị ký một giao kèo độc quyền vào năm 1964 với một giá rất cao vào thời đó là nửa triệu đồng. Mỗi tháng thu thanh 4 nhạc phẩm, dù không có bài để thu vẫn được trả lương. Với Sóng Nhạc, Phương Dung tiếp tục làm say mê thính giả với tiếng hát cao chót vót của mình trong những ca khúc đã trở thành bất hủ như Huyền Sử Ca Một Người Mang tên Quốc (hát với nhật Trường), Những Đồi Hoa Sim, vv…Riêng Những Đồi Hoa Sim do Dũng Chinh phổ nhạc từ thơ của Hữu Loan đã được dùng làm nhạc phẩm chính cho cuốn phim Tiếng Hát Nửa Khuya (\"Songs At Night\") do Phòng Thông Tin Hoa Kỳ thực hiện vào năm 1964. Trong phim này Phương Dung đã được mời thủ diễn một vai quan trọng bên cạnh nam tài tử Huy Cường. Ngoài Những Đồi Hoa Sim, còn một vài nhạc phẩm khác do Phương Dung trình bày cũng được đưa vào cuốn phim này như Không Bao Giờ Ngăn Cách, Bóng Đêm, vv..\n\nCũng trong lãnh vực điện ảnh, Phương Dung từng được mời đóng một vai nhỏ trong phim \"Hai Chuyến Xe Hoa\". Sau này, trong thời gian cư ngụ tại Úc, chị cũng từng được mời xuất hiện trong bộ phim \"Mission:Impossible\"\n\nĐến năm 1965, Phương Dung chuyển qua trình bày nhiều nhạc phẩm của Trần Thiện Thanh và rất được khán thính giả thích thú.. Cũng trong năm đó, nhạc phẩm Tạ Từ Trong Đêm của Trần Thiện Thanh do Phương Dung trình bày đã đoạt giải Bài Hát Hay Nhất cùng với Huy Chương Vàng dành cho ca sĩ trình bày xuất sắc do Thanh Thương Hội trao tặng. Ngoài ra cũng với Tạ Từ Trong Đêm, Phương Dung còn được tạp chí Sân Khấu của ký giả Nguyễn Ang Ca trao giải Nữ Ca Sĩ Được Cảm Tình Nhất Năm 65. Ngoài những sáng tác của Trần Thiện Thanh, tiếng hát Phương Dung còn được biết đến nhiều với những nhạc phẩm của Thanh Sơn, Hoàng Trang, Hồng Vân, Thu Hồ và đặc biệt những sáng tác của nhóm Lê Minh Bằng.\n\nTừ giữa thập niên 60, Phương Dung đã trở thành một trong những giọng ca được mến mộ nhất với thể loại nhạc thời trang. Từ quê ra tỉnh, \"Con Nhạn Trắng Gò Công\" với tiếng hát đặc biệt của mình hầu như đã chinh phục tất cả mọi người. Riêng tại Sài Gòn, Phương Dung đã cộng tác liên tiếp trong những năm 95, 96 và 97 mỗi đêm với 7 phòng trà và vũ trường. Đó là Tự Do, Maxim’s, Olympia, Quốc Tế, Bồng Lai, Paramount và Văn Cảnh. Đó là một thành tích hiếm có ca sĩ nào đạt nổi.\n\nPhương Dung cũng nằm trong số những nữ ca sĩ quen thuộc của các chương trình đại nhạc hội. Chị còn thường xuyên xuất hiện trong những chương trình truyền hình hoặc cộng tác với những chương trình phát thanh trên cả hai đài Quân Đội và Sài Gòn.\n\nViệc xây dựng hôn nhân đã đến với Phương Dung vào năm 1967 sau khi gặp người chồng tương lai một cách thật tình cờ tại Bangkok, Thái Lan, một năm trước đó trong một dịp sang đây hát. Vị đại sứ thời đó là em bà luật sư Trương Đình Du và là anh ruột của đạo diễn Võ Doãn Châu đã mời Phương Dung đến thăm tòa đại sứ Việt Nam Cộng Hòa tại đây. Và chính tở đó chị đã gặp anh Võ Doãn Ngọc, hơn chị 13 tuổi, là người đã trở thành người bạn đời của chị sau đó. Anh Ngọc du học tại Pháp từ năm 13, 14 tuổi. Sau đó sang Thụy Sĩ làm việc và tình cờ gặp Phương Dung trong một dịp sang Bangkok nghỉ Tết với gia đình. Sau lần gặp Phương Dung, anh Ngọc tự ý thôi việc để về Việt Nam xin cưới người mà anh đã cảm thấy rung động ngay trong lần gặp gỡ đầu tiên. Đó cũng là lần thứ nhất anh Ngọc trở lại Việt Nam và lưu lại đây luôn cho đến khi cùng vợ và các con vựợt biên. Sau khi thành hôn, từ năm 1968, Phương Dung quyết định nghỉ hát trong khi tên tuổi vẫn đang trên đà lên cao . Lý do này được chị giải thích là: \" tại vì lúc đó thật sự mà nói thứ nhất là Tết Mậu Thân kéo dài thì ông xã cứ nói, thôi mình lập gia đình cbo rồi. Thì nghĩ thôi thì lập gia đình đi vì mình lúc bấy giờ đã 22, 23 tuổi rồi. Với lại thật tình mà nói là lúc đó cũng thấy cái tình cảm ông theo đuổi mình mình cũng cảm động nữa. Vậy cho nên mình lập gia đình trong thời gian đó cho rồi\"\n\nSau khi lập gia đình. Phương Dung cùng chồng theo đuổi ngành kinh doanh. Họ sở hữu một trại gà và một số tầu đánh cá ở Gò Công. Ngoài ra hai người còn điều hành một công ty xuất khẩu tôm đông lạnh nên cuộc sống vật chất rất thoải mái. Hai lần xuất hiện cuối cùng của Phương Dung đã diễn ra trong một chương trình đại nhạc hội tổ chức tại hai rạp Quốc Thanh và Hưng Đạo đã đánh dấu cho quyết định quan trọng của \"Con Nhạn Trắng Gò Công\". Sau đó, Phương Dung chỉ còn một sự liên hệ về ca hát qua những lần thu thanh cho hãng Continental của nhạc sĩ Nguyễn Văn Đông cho đến năm 1975. Hai băng nhạc nổi tiếng của Phương Dung trong giai đoạn này là \"Sơn Ca 5\" và \"Sơn Ca 11\" dưới nhãn hiệu Continental đã đạt được một số bán rất cao.\n\nPhương Dung cho biết vợ chồng chị không có những sở thích giống nhau. Lý do dễ hiểu là anh Ngọc là một người theo Tây học, chịu ảnh hưởng nặng nề của nền văn hoá Tây phương. Trong khi Phương Dung là một người mang nặng tình cảm quê hương với nền văn hoá hoàn toàn Việt Nam. Nhưng theo chị, có thể nhờ vậy họ đã có được một sự bổ sung cần thiết cho nhau… Và cũng nhờ thế, hai người đã sống một cuộc sống hạnh phúc cho đến nay đã được đúng 40 năm. Vợ chồng Phương Dung có với nhau tất cả 8 người con: 6 trai và 2 gái. Hai người con gái của chị tên Hoàng Ly (tên đặt dựa trên một bài thơ Đường của Đỗ Phủ) và Phương Vy. Phương Vy từng có thời kỳ xuất hiện trên vài chương trình Paris By Night với những nhạc phẩm ngoại quốc trẻ trung. Trong khi đó cô chị Hoàng Ly lại đi theo con đường nhạc thời trang của mẹ. Cả hai hiện đang có ý định quay trở lại với những sinh hoạt ca nhạc sau khi mới hoàn tất một CD.\n\nHai năm sau khi xẩy ra biến cố tháng 4 năm 75, hai vợ chồng Phương Dung và các con vượt biên bằng tầu của gia đình vào năm 1977. Họ tới được Mã Lai và được phái đoàn Mỹ nhận cho định cư ngay, nhưng vợ chồng chị từ chối để xin đi Úc. Bây giờ nghĩ lại Phương Dung nhận biết đó là một quyết định sai lầm đối với một người muốn theo con đường ca hát , theo lời chị kể:\" phái đoàn Mỹ nói, cô là ca sĩ mà. Ở bên Mỹ người ta gủi thư về đây nói rằng có một cô ca sĩ ở đây vì vậy chúng tôi cho cô đi Mỹ. Nhưng tại lúc đó mình nghe nói bên Úc người tỵ nạn được ưu đãi lắm, hơn nữa nước này có đất đai rộng rãi nên vợ chồng tôi quyết định xin định cư ở Úc. Nhưng bây giờ hối hân lắm. Thật ra cái nghề của mình là phải ở Mỹ vì có nhiềun cơ hội lắm. Nhưng dù sao thì cũng có một bàn tay vô hình sắp đặt cho mình Thành ra khi mà mình đã đi đâu cứ đi theo đi mình đừng đi ngược lại cái định mệnh đã an bài cho mình. Đi ngược lại mình gian nan, mình khổ lắm!\" Từ đó Phương Dung càng tin ở số mệnh hơn để có được kinh nghiệm là số mệnh mình đã có từ lúc mình sanh ra cho tới khi trưởng thành. Được an bài, sắp xếp như thế nào thì cứ nên theo như vậy.\n\nGia đình Phương Dung tới Úc năm 77 và cư ngụ ở Melbourne. Chỉ 8 tháng sau khi tới đây, hai vợ chồng chị đã đứng ra khai thác 2 nhà hàng có trình diễn ca nhạc là Cửu Long và Tự Do. Sau khi không còn khai thác nhà hàng vào năm 1983, Phương Dung nhận được lời kời sang Mỹ của nhạc sĩ Anh Bằng để thu cuốn băng đầu tiên tại hải ngoại mang tựa đề Kỷ Niệm Còn Đây, gồm 10 ca khúc tiêu biểu của Phương Dung Năm 84, chị trở lại làm tổng đại lý những phim bộ Hồng Kông chuyển âm tiếng Việt . Nhưng chỉ được một thời gian vì quá vất vả và nhất là tiền bản quyền càng ngày càng cao, nên chị chuyển qua làm với một người con trong ngành may mặc. Đến năm 89, 90 chị hoàn tất thủ tục xin định cư tại Mỹ. Hai người con gái của chị đã đã có quốc tịch Mỹ trước đó. Riêng những người con trai của chị vẫn sống tại Úc.\n\nTừ khi sang Mỹ đến nay, Phương Dung hầu như chỉ cộng tác với trung tâm Asia với những ca khúc quen thuộc của thể loại nhạc thời trang ngày nào… Một thời lẫy lừng tên tuổi của \"Con Nhạn Trắng Gò Công\" đã qua đi. Đối với Phương Dung đó cũng là sự sắp đặt của định mệnh nên chị chẳng hề có một điều gì tiếc nuối. Có chăng là những kỷ niệm đẹp về cuộc đời đi hát của mình. Từ hơn 12 năm nay chị chỉ chú tâm vào những công tác từ thiện, một mặt chú tâm vào việc tu học để tìm được sự thanh thản trong tâm hồn. Các con Phương Dung cũng rất khuyến khích mẹ trong những việc làm từ thiện đúng với chủ trươnng của chị là luôn cần phải phát tâm Bồ Đề, đi theo con đường của Đức Quan Thế Âm để nghe ngoíng tiếng kêu than của loài người đau khổ. Cũng như chị tuy là một người theo Phật Giáo, nhưng cũng coi những việc làm của mình như những việc tông đồ bên Công Giáo theo lời khuyên của Chúa là làm vui người cũng như làm vui mình. Nhờ vậy chị thấy cuộc đời có nhiều ý nghĩa hơn, nhất là được chồng và các con ủng hộ. Phương Dung từng đóng góp cho Dòng Đa Minh vào việc mổ mắt cho những giáo dân ở Long Khánh, giúp đỡ Dòng Mến thánh Giá ở Phan Rang cũng như tặng nhiều phần quà cho những người thuộc dân tộc thiểu số ở đây, vv…thêm vào đó là góp một bàn tay vào việc xây hồ, đào giếng cho đồng bào ở một số vùng xa xôi.\n\nHiện Phương Dung chỉ còn một ước nguyện là thực hiện một DVD để kỷ niệm về cuộc đới đi hát của mình. Sau đó chị sẽ xuất gia là một tu sĩ để đi theo hạnh Bồ Tát cho đến cuối đời…',4009,21926),(293,'Back II Black','',3480,89007),(294,'Erik Grip','Erik Grip is a danish folk musician - born 2nd july 1947.

One of the most famous Brazilian pop rock bands, they are well known for the song \"Camila, Camila\".\n\n\nAfter having helped form the band Engenheiros do Hawaii and playing in two shows, Carlos Stein left the band to form another band with some friends that he had known since elementary school, Sady Homrich and Thedy Correa. In 1986 in Rio Grande do Sul they started playing together and came up with the name Nenhum de Nós (None of Us). They wanted a name that would spark the curiosity of others, but also showed something that each of them had in common: None of us sees very well, None of us stayed in school, None of us joined the army, etc...\nThedy sang and played the acoustic guitar as a bass, Carlos played electric guitar and Sady played the drums. After only 6 shows the band caught the interests of a music producer from São Paulo and recorded their first album, Nenhum de Nós. The album was released in 1987 and contained their now classic Camila, Camila.\nTwo Years later, in 1989, they released their next album Cardume. Among the songs included on the album was \"O Astronauta de Mármore\" (\"The Marble Astronaut\"), a Portuguese language version of David Bowie\'s \"Starman\".

Show\" He began as a classical pianist, studying at the Havana Conservatory and under a Cuban government scholarship in Paris. At the age of 16, he moved to the U.S., first attending the Cambridge School of Music and then the Juilliard School of Music in New York. While at Juilliard, Melis learned to switch hats and perform as a lounge pianist and pop accompanist to pay the rent.\n\nJose Melis LPDrafted in 1943, he served as the musical director of the USO in New York City, playing at what was, in effect, one of the hottest clubs in the city. His Army duty threw him in with a wide variety of talents, including a young comic named Jack Paar.\n\nMelis became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1944 and remained in New York after the war. After a few years of working in nightclubs and on radio, Paar looked him up again and asked Melis to work as musical director for a show he was producing and starring in. Although the radio series was short-lived, Paar and Melis stayed in touch, and they collaborated on several other quickly-forgotten shows for CBS Television.\n\nFinally, Paar lucked out with a late-night talk and variety show called the \"Tonight! Show.\" The \"Tonight! Show\" became a hit. Paar put Melis\' orchestra on the stage, rather than in the pit, and from the beginning, he included Melis in the on-camera patter that became one of the trademarks of the show. Melis\' lively personality was popular with the show\'s audience, and became something of a star in own right, earning increasing airtime for his blend of pop and classical music (ala Liberace). Melis\' \"I-M-4-U\" was used as the show\'s original theme song.\n\nHis \"Tonight! Show\" fame was translated into record contracts, first with the Latin-oriented Seeco label and later with Mercury. He left the show to concentrate on his own act, but although he toured with Mel Torme and even accompanied Frank Sinatra on several occasions, his star eventually faded in the early 1960s. He suffered a serious vision loss in the mid-1970s and lost his hearing in the 1980s. In 2003, he moved from the Bronxville, New York house he\'d lived in since the \"Tonight!

Although his parents ran a cafe, they were also great music enthusiasts, and Baselli began taking music lessons at the age of six. He and his brother Enrico both studied the accordion and, after a few years of serenading patrons in their parents\' cafe, began playing on a semi-professional basis by their late teens.\n\nAfter World War Two, Baselli met an accomplished accordion player and pioneer of the bal musette style, Gus Viseur, who encouraged him to pursue a career in music. Baselli moved to Paris in 1950 and several years later, while working a summer job in Pau, near the Spanish border, met the rising young chanteuse, Patachou. She offered him the job of principal accompanist, and as her career took off, rivalling Edith Piaf\'s in popularity, he became a recognized soloist in his own right. Patachou opened a cafe in the Montmartre section of Paris, which became the center of the bal musette scene. Around the same time, Joss married Gus Viseur\'s daughter.\n\nIn 1958, Patachou toured the U.S. and Baselli attracted the attention of Sid Frey, owner of the Audio Fidelity record label. Frey was about to release the first series of long-playing stereo records and was signing numerous international artists. Renaming him Jo Basile, Frey first recorded Baselli straight, playing instrumental versions of Patachou\'s hits and other French cafe tunes.\n\nThen Baselli suggested he do some of the Italian songs he grew up playing in his parents\' cafe, and the album, Rome with Love was released, with a cover featuring a sexy babe in Capri pants riding on the back of a Vespa. Whether the cover had anything to do with the success of the record, Frey figured it was a winning combination, and most of the two dozen albums Basselli recorded for Audio Fidelity over the next five years followed a standard formula. Basselli played a dozen or so tunes associated with a particular country or city, and Frey slapped on a cover featuring another sexy babe in national garb riding on the back of the same red Vespa--with an appropriate license plate.\n\nFor the quantity of material reflected in this series, the quality of performances is quite high. Baselli was a virtuoso accordion player, whose talents are now comemorated in France by an annual award that bears his name, given for the best accordion performance. For the most part, though, the material doesn\'t match the musicianship.\n\nA couple of the series, however, deserve a closer listen. Swingin\' Latin is actually a set of early bossa nova tunes performed with the excellent Brazilian trio, Bossa Tres, and it\'s been reissued on CD recently as Jo Basile and Bossa Tres by Ubatuqui Records.\n\nMy favorite is Foreign Film Festival album, on which he swings through a set of tunes by Nino Rota and others with a crack group of New York session men that includes Bobby Rosengarden, Dick Hyman, Al Caiola, Milt Hinton, and Phil Kraus. It\'s a jazzy take on theme music from such early 1960s classics as \"La Dolce Vita,\" \"Rififi,\" and \"8½\" that shows Basselli could easily hold his own among players with such impeccable jazz chops and studio experience.\n\nIn all, Basselli\'s Audio Fidelity albums sold over 4 million copies in the U.S. He was awarded a prize by the American Accordion Association, and undoubtedly inspired many young men to take up the squeezebox--at least, until they discovered it tended not to attract sexy chick in Capri pants the way an electric guitar did.\n\nBack in France, Basselli parted ways with Patachou and joined the studio team of the singer Barbara, who launched an enormously successful variety series on French television. Basselli not only performed on screen as both accompanist and soloist, he also worked as musical director and arranged hundreds of songs for the show.\n\nHe stayed with the show until 1967, when he reunited with Patachou for another tour of the U.S. When he returned to France, he began to turn his attention to composing and arranging. He wrote the score for the movie, \"L\'astragale,\" as well as for numerous television shows. One of the most notable of these was \"Le Manège Enchanté,\" a stop-action animated series by Serge Danot. A BBC producer asked actress Emma Thompson\'s father, Eric, to translate and record an English language narration, but Thompson decided the scripts just didn\'t work in English, and he wrote his own story, even renaming the characters. As \"The Magic Roundabout,\" the series was an even bigger success in the U.K. Basselli also composed the score for the full-length film Danot produced as a spin-off from the series, \"Dougal and the Blue Cat\".\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Baselli also worked as a songwriter, and his best-known tune, \"Free Again,\" was recorded by numerous Anglophone singers--most notably, Barbra Streisand, on the first track of her 1966 album, My Name is Barbra.\n\nIn 1972, Basselli hosted a series on French television titled, \"Le monde de l\'accordeon,\" which featured masters of the instrument and encouraged young people to take up and learn the instrument. This time, no chick in Capri pants was promised. He also founded his own music publishing company, Opaline, to oversee the rights to his various compositions, and wrote a popular set of music instruction books on playing the accordion.

The original line up was Alan Hull, Ray Jackson, Ray Laidlaw, Rod Clements, and Simon Cowe.  \nThe group released their debut Nicely out of Tune in 1970. Their second album, Fog on the Tyne, was produced by Bob Johnson, who had also worked with Bob Dylan, to whom Alan Hull was being compared at the time.  Following their third album, Dingly Dell, the group split and Lindisfarne (Mark II) continued with new members, and produced a few more albums before disbanding in 1975, seemingly for good.\n1978 saw the original group re-form, with the album Back and Fourth, and the hit single \"Run for Home\".  This line-up continued for many years. New member Marty Craggs came in for the 1986 album Dance Your Life Away. Ray \'Jacka\' Jackson eventualy left to work in London, and then Si Cowe left to run a brewery in Canada. Jackson now (2008) has a career as an artist, specialising in colourful paintings of buses, a passion since he was a boy.

His family emigrated to the United States in 1920 and settled in Santa Rosa, California. He started his musical career playing the baritone, like his father, but he quickly branched out into other instruments, notably the French horn and the piano. He received a bachelor\'s degree from San Francisco State College, and then studied composition with Darius Milhaud at Mills College in Oakland, California.\n\nAfter he graduated, he was hired as an arranger and composer by guitarist and bandleader Johnny Richards. He spent World War II playing with Paul Desmond in an army band.\n\nAfter WWII Rugolo went to work for Stan Kenton who headed one of the most progressive big bands of the time. Rugolo provided arrangements and original compositions that drew on his knowledge of 20th century music, sometimes blurring the boundaries between the ballroom and the concert hall.\n\nWhile Rugolo continued to work occasionally with Kenton in the 1950s, he spent more time creating arrangements for pop vocalists, including June Christy, Peggy Lee and the Four Freshmen. During this period he also worked for a while on musicals at MGM, and served as an A&R director for Mercury Records in the late 1950s. Among his many albums were Adventures In Rhythm, Introducing Pete Rugolo, Rugolomania, Reeds In Hi-Fi and Music For Hi-Fi Bugs.',3817,33204),(314,'Kumar Bapi','',232,2041),(315,'His Name Is Alive','Named after history class notes on Abraham Lincoln, the Livonia, MI-based sonic manipulators His Name Is Alive formed when multi-instrumentalist/producer Warren Defever (also of shockabilly group Elvis Hitler) was still in high school. Defever, former schoolmate Karin Oliver (vocals), and drummer Damian Lang released self-produced cassettes of their music, one of which made its way to Ivo Watts-Russell, founder of the pioneering art label 4AD. Intrigued with His Name Is Alive\'s blend of spectral vocals, poetic lyrics, and textural guitars, Watts signed the band.\n\nThe group recorded its first release for the label, Livonia, in Defever\'s home studio. The album features Oliver\'s shivery vocals along with tape loops, samples, and guitar blasts, for a noise-damaged, ethereal collection of songs about ghosts, reincarnation, and dreams. By 1992\'s Home Is in Your Head, the band\'s lineup and scope expanded. New singers Denise James, Karen Neal, Melissa Elliott, and guitarist Jymn Auge added depth and breadth to the band\'s original lineup. An epic 23 songs long, Home Is in Your Head ranges from folky ballads to electrifying guitar maelstroms and tape collages. That year also saw the release of The Dirt Eaters EP, named for Defever\'s other, more rock-oriented group, of which Elliot was also a member. In 1993, His Name Is Alive released two albums: King of Sweet, a limited-edition release that mixed tape effects, samples, demos, and unreleased songs, and Mouth by Mouth, which added more pop structure into the group\'s inherently experimental and dreamy sound, resulting in its most accessible and diverse album to that date. A new drummer, Trey Many, took over Lang\'s duties.\n\nAs Defever\'s reputation as an innovative producer spread, he lent his skills to bands like Grenadine, a side project of Tsunami\'s Jenny Toomey and Unrest\'s Mark Robinson, other 4AD acts like Liquorice (which featured Toomey, Dan Littleton from Ida, and His Name Is Alive\'s Many) and Tarnation, and other Detroit-area bands like Godzuki and Outrageous Cherry. Defever also worked on other projects, including the folky ESP Summer (with former Pale Saint Ian Masters) and the electronic Robot World and Control Panel, and founded the Time Stereo art collective with a childhood friend, artist/musician Davin Brainard. Some of Time Stereo\'s projects included films, coloring books, and cassette-only releases from bands like Princess Dragon Mom, the Crash, Godzuki, New Grape, and Noise Camp.\n\nDefever\'s diverse interests influenced His Name Is Alive\'s next release, 1996\'s Stars on ESP. Very little of the group\'s original ethereal sound remained, augmented instead with touches of dub, folk, gospel, and early- to mid-\'60s pop like the Beach Boys\' Pet Sounds. At the time of the album\'s release, Defever claimed that he was so fascinated by the group\'s \"Good Vibrations\" that he listened to it for months at a time. The following year\'s Nice Day EP reached to garage rock and \'60s R&B for its inspiration, and featured some of the gospel singers from Stars on ESP, including Lovetta Pippen, whose singing also gave His Name Is Alive\'s 1998 LP, Fort Lake, an earthy sensuality. Fort Lake also marked the first time the band worked with another producer, recording engineer Steve King. King, another Livonia native, had also worked with Funkadelic and Aretha Franklin, and his touch meshes nicely with the funk, soul, and classic rock allusions His Name Is Alive makes on the album. In preparation for recording Fort Lake -- named after a waterlogged Civil War fort in Michigan -- the group played monthly shows at the Gold Dollar, a tiny Detroit club. At this time, Pippen, bassist Chad Gilchrist, and additional drummer Scott Goldstein debuted as part of the new lineup.\n\nIn 1999, His Name Is Alive released a U.S. compilation of tracks from their first five albums called Always Stay Sweet; at the time, those albums were only available as British imports. Like the rest of the band\'s work, the compilation highlights their mercurial, unique nature. Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth appeared two years later. Released in 2002, the darkly soulful Last Night ended up being the group\'s final album for 4AD, but His Name Is Alive found other outlets for their music, and were actually busier than ever. Time Stereo released several CDs, such as 2004\'s ten-disc Cloud Box set, Leaf Club, Brown Rice, and The Detroit River, as well as many MP3-only works, including the Summer Bird and Something_Nothing EPs and a remastered version of King of Sweet. UFO Catcher was released in 2005 on CD by the German label En/Of and on vinyl by Time Stereo, while Ypsilanti Records issued the full-length Summer Bird that spring. Late in 2005, His Name Is Alive released the Raindrops Rainbow EP via iTunes as a teaser for Detrola, their debut for Reincarnate, also the home of fellow former 4AD artist Lisa Germano and Sing-Sing, the project of former Lush member Emma Anderson.',200805,3108172),(316,'Earl Bostic','Earl Bostic (April 25, 1913 – October 28, 1965) was an American jazz and rhythm and blues alto saxophonist.\n\nBostic was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He turned professional at age 18 when he joined Terrence Holder\'s band. He made his first recording with Lionel Hampton in 1942 where he played along with Red Allen, J.C. Higginbotham, Sid Catlett, Teddy Wilson and Hampton. Before that he performed with Fate Marable on New Orleans riverboats. Bostic graduated from Xavier University in New Orleans. He worked with territory bands as well as Arnett Cobb, Hot Lips Page, Rex Stewart, Don Byas, Charlie Christian, Thelonious Monk and other jazz luminaries. He formed his own band in 1945, and turned to rhythm and blues in the late 1940s. His biggest hits were \"Temptation,\" \"Sleep,\" \"Flamingo,\" \"You Go to My Head\" and \"Cherokee.\" At various times his band included Jaki Byard, John Coltrane, Benny Golson, Blue Mitchell, Stanley Turrentine, Tommy Turrentine, Keter Betts, Sir Charles Thompson, Teddy Edwards, Tony Scott, Benny Carter and other musicians who rose to prominence in jazz. Bostic held his musicians to a high standard and demanded that they read music faultlessly. He was influenced by the great Sidney Bechet. John Coltrane in turn was influenced by Earl Bostic. James Moody said that Bostic was the chief influence on John Coltrane. Moody mentioned that \"Bostic knew his instrument inside out, back to front and upside down.\"\n\nHis virtuosity is documented in records such as Up There In Orbit, Earl\'s Imagination, Apollo Theater Jump, All On, Artistry by Bostic, Telestar Drive, Liza, Lady Be Good and Tiger Rag. Bostic was a master of the blues and he used this skill in a variety of musical settings. Although Bostic recorded many commercial albums, some notable jazz based exceptions on the King label include Bostic Rocks Hits of the Swing Age, Jazz As I Feel It and A New Sound.\n\nBostic\'s King album titled Jazz As I Feel It featured Shelly Manne on drums, Joe Pass on guitar and Groove Holmes on organ. Bostic recorded the King Album \"A New Sound\" about one month later again, featuring Holmes and Pass. These recordings allowed Bostic to stretch out beyond the 3 minute limit imposed by the 45 RPM format. Bostic was pleased with the sessions which highlight his total mastery of the blues but they also foreshadowed musical advances that were later evident in the work of John Coltrane and Eric Dolphy.\n\nHe wrote arrangements for Paul Whiteman, Louis Prima, Lionel Hampton, Gene Krupa, Artie Shaw, Jack Teagarden and Alvino Rey.\n\nBostic\'s signature hit, \"Flamingo\" was recorded in 1951 and remains a favorite among followers of Carolina Beach Music in South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Their style of Beach Music is heavily influenced by Rhythm-and-Blues music from the 40\'s, 50\'s and 60\'s. Bostic recorded for Cincinnati-based King Records, a small label that was well known for releasing \"R and B\" and Bluegrass records. In fact, the biggest star on the King label was \"the Godfather of Soul\", James Brown. Bostic was also popular among R&B and jazz followers in the United Kingdom, thanks to his records that were released on the Parlophone label.\n\nBostic died from a heart attack in Rochester, New York, while performing with his band in 1965.

Born in London in 1932, her early recordings were mainly ballads, in the style of Anne Shelton. But by 1954, this was to all change. Her first major hit was \"Bell Bottom Blues\", and she scored her only number one in Britain with \"Dreamboat\" in 1956. Novelty songs were extremely popular at the time, and Alma recorded a number of these, including \"I Can\'t Tell A Waltz From A Tango\", \"Twenty Tiny Fingers\" and \"Never Do A Tango With An Eskimo\". She was known for the giggle in her voice when she sang and was affectinaltely known as The Girl With A Laugh In Her Voice. Her extravagant dresses were also a trademark. Her final UK hit was \"Cowboy Jimmy Joe\" in 1961, but was fast becoming an International Artist, with hits in Sweden, Germany, Israel and Japan - she had a number one hit in Japan with \"Just Couldn\'t Resist Her With Her Pocket Transistor\" which was at the top spot for over six months. As the novelty numbers were fast becoming old-fashioned by the start of the 1960s, she recorded a number of jazz standards and pop records, including five songs written by the Beatles - these recordings can be found on a number of CDs. Famed for her showbiz parties, with guests like Cary Grant, Noel Coward and the Beatles, she was never out of the public eye until ovarian cancer tragically cut her career short.

In the mid 1960s she was singing with jazz musician Finn Ziegler, and it was suggested in 1966 that she enter a song in the Danish Eurovision selection, Dansk Melodi Grand Prix. She performed the song \"Stop - mens legen er go\'\" (\"Stop, While the Going\'s Good\"), and to her surprise, emerged the clear winner. Ulla Pia stated in a recent interview that she had assumed that one of her better-known competitors (such as Dario Campeotto or Gustav Winckler) would win, and her victory came as a shock to her. Ulla Pia went forward to the eleventh Eurovision Song Contest, held on 5 March in Luxembourg City, where \"Stop - mens legen er go\'\" could manage only 14th place of the 18 entries, despite an engaging performance in which Ulla Pia was joined on stage, unusually for the time, by two dancers. It would prove to be Denmark\'s last Eurovision appearance for over a decade, as broadcaster DR withdrew from the competition in 1967, and would not return until 1978.\n\nIn the years following her Eurovision appearance, Ulla Pia went on to release several popular singles in Denmark, notably \"Karina\" and the topical \"Flower Power Tøj\". She toured regularly into the 1970s, but towards the end of the decade increasing family commitments, combined with a period of ill-health, caused her to retire from showbusiness.',2794,14205),(328,'AHMED HASSAN','',487,2137),(329,'Hương Lan','In 1961, when she was only five years old, Hương Lan was introduced to the stage by her father, actor Huu Phuoc.

He is well known for a successful collaboration with fellow trombonist J. J. Johnson.\n\nWinding was born in Aarhus, Denmark. In 1934 his family emigrated to the United States. He graduated in 1940 from Stuyvesant High School in New York City, plus that same year he began his career as a professional trombonist with Shorty Allen\'s band. Subsequently, he played with Sonny Dunham and Alvino Rey until he entered the United States Coast Guard during World War II.\n\nAfter the war, Winding joined Benny Goodman\'s band, and later moved on to Stan Kenton\'s orchestra. Winding participated in the first of the Birth of the Cool sessions in 1949, appearing on 4 of the 12 tracks (while J. J. Johnson appears on the other eight, having participated on the other two sessions). In 1954, at the urging of producer Ozzie Cadena, he joined forces with Johnson to produce a highly successful series of trombone duet recordings, which were initially on Savoy Records and then on the Columbia Records label. While at Columbia, Winding experimented with different instrumentation in brass ensembles: the 1956 album Jay & Kai + 6 features a trombone octet, as well as Winding and Johnson performing on the trombone-like valved horn called the trombonium. Winding also arranged and/or composed many of the tracks he and Johnson recorded. Unlike most players who absorbed the \"bebop\" style, Winding notably used more overtly trombonistic slide and mute effects from the earlier eras of jazz, as had another former Goodman trombonist Bill Harris, sounds which Johnson studiously avoided.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Winding had a long stint at Verve Records and under producer Creed Taylor made some of his most memorable jazz-pop albums. He released the first version of \"Time Is On My Side\" in 1963 before it was recorded by Irma Thomas and The Rolling Stones. His best selling recording from this period is \"More,\" the theme from the movie Mondo Cane. Arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman, \"More\" featured what is probably the first appearance of the French electronic music instrument the Ondioline on an American recording. Though Winding himself was credited with playing the Ondioline, guitarist Vinnie Bell, who worked on the session, has said he remembers distinctly that the French electronic-music pioneer Jean-Jacques Perrey was the actual player. He served as Musical Director for the Playboy Club, in mid-sixties New York, when rock was beginning to edge out jazz as the fashionable club music.\n\nWhile at Verve, Winding further experimented with various ensembles, made solo albums, and even an album of country music with the Anita Kerr Singers. In the late 1960s, Winding followed Creed Taylor to his new recording label at A&M/CTI and made at least two more albums with Johnson.\n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, Winding recorded for a number of independent record labels. During this time, he continued to give clinics, play jazz concerts and even reunited with Johnson for a live concert in Japan. He was a member of the all-star jazz group Giants of Jazz in 1971-2. He also wrote instructional jazz trombone books that included transcribed solos.\n\nWinding died of a brain tumor in New York City in 1983. He was survived at the time by his wife, the accomplished painter Ezshwan Winding, and his son, the session keyboardist Jai Winding.\n\nDiscography\n\nAs leader/co-leader\nKai Winding All Stars (Roost, 1949-51 [1952])\nTrombone by Three (Prestige, 1949 [1956]) with J.

Hugo Winterhalter was born August 15, 1909 in Wilkes-Barre, PA, later studying violin and reed instruments at the New England Conservatory of Music. After graduating, he taught school for several years before turning professional during the mid-1930s, serving as a sideman and arranger for Count Basie, Tommy Dorsey, Raymond Scott, Claude Thornhill and others. Winterhalter also arranged and conducted sessions for singers including Dinah Shore and Billy Eckstine, and in 1948 he was named musical director at MGM Records. After a two-year stint with the label, he moved to Columbia Records, where he scored a hit with his orchestral reading of \"Blue Christmas.\"\n\nIn 1950, Winterhalter signed on with RCA Victor, where he arranged sessions for artists including Perry Como, Eddie Fisher and the Ames Brothers; he also recorded several instrumental albums, among them 1952\'s Great Music Themes of Television, one of the first collections of TV theme songs ever recorded. Winterhalter also notched a series of chart hits, including \"Blue Tango,\" \"Vanessa,\" \"The Little Shoemaker\" and \"Song of The Barefoot Contessa\"; with pianist Eddie Heywood, he even reached the number two spot with 1956\'s \"Canadian Sunset.\"\n\nWinterhalter remained with RCA until 1963, at which time he moved to Kapp; that same year, he also penned the main title theme for the film Diamond Head. At Kapp he recorded a handful of albums including The Best of \'64 and its follow-up, The Big Hits of 1965, before leaving the label to work on Broadway. He later worked in television as well, and continued recording the occasional LP for various budget labels. Winterhalter died in Greenwich, Connecticut on September 17, 1973.',13303,68517),(333,'NGỌC HUỆ','Ngọc Huệ (1968-    ) is a famous overseas Vietnamese singer.\n\nFrom early on, Ngọc Huệ had taken a keen interest in performing arts.  While growing up in Saigon, she had already studied ballet and acting prior to reaching her teenage years.  From 1977 until 1979, Ngọc Huệ had taken voice lessons at Quốc Gia Âm Nhạc, University of Ho Chi Minh City, School of Fine Arts.  In 1981, she resettled in Sydney, Australia.  While in Australia, Ngọc Huệ began her career as a professional overseas Vietnamese singer.  In 1990, Ngọc Huệ resettled in the United States and began recording for such labels like New Castle Entertainment, Diễm Xưa, Hải Âu, Tektronic, Mai Productions and Thúy Nga.   In just one year, she was voted by Hồn Việt Magazine as \"Giọng Ca Mới Của Năm 90\" (New Singer of the Year in 1990).  She even formed her own production label called Fame Productions in the 1990s.  Ngọc Huệ has recorded duet albums with Anh Tú, Kỳ Anh, Don Hồ and Nhật Trường.\nIn 1992, Ngọc Huệ made her debut appearance on Thúy Nga\'s Paris By Night video series on volume 16 with a solo performance of Prisoner (written by Alan Nguyễn) along with a duet performance with Don Hồ of the song, Hạnh Phúc Trong Tim.  Throughout the 1990s, Ngọc Huệ was invited back on the Paris By Night video series on several occasions performing in duets with Don Hồ and Thái Tài.  Her last appearance to date on the series was on volume 55 in 2000 with a solo performance of the song, Thu Vàng Trên Lói (written by Khúc Lan).\n\nNgọc Huệ has performed live in concerts for Vietnamese audiences all over the United States, Canada, Europe including Russia, Australia and Vietnam.',82,605),(334,'Satinath Mukherjee','',522,3040),(335,'Lolita Garrido','Lolita Garrido (Dolores Garrido Guardiola, Manises, Valencia, 24 March 1928 - 15 November 2018) was a Spanish bolero singer. Nicknamed \"The Bride of Swing\". \n\nThe oldest type of bolero originated in Spain during the late 18th century as a form of ballroom music, which influenced art music composers around the world, most famously Maurice Ravel\'s Boléro, as well as a flamenco style known as boleras.',1272,6124),(336,'Bay City Rollers','The Bay City Rollers were a Scottish pop band of the 1970s. Their youthful, clean-cut image, distinct styling featuring tartan-trimmed outfits, and cheery, sing-along pop hits helped the group become among the most popular musical acts of their time. For a relatively brief but fervent period (nicknamed \"Rollermania\"), they were a worldwide sensation.\n\nBassist Alan Longmuir, his younger brother Derek Longmuir, a drummer, along with school mate, lead singer Gordon \"Nobby\" Clark founded the group in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1967, as The Saxons. Shortly afterwards, seeking a less English-sounding moniker, they chose a new name allegedly by throwing a dart at a map of the United States. The dart landed on the map in the state of Arkansas, but since \"Arkansas Rollers\" did not sound quite right, and might also lead to problems with pronunciation, they tried again and this time the dart landed near the community of Bay City, Michigan.\n\nThe Bay City Rollers were managed from early on by the imposing and controversial Tam Paton, himself a former big band leader. Paton was notorious for his rigid control over all aspects of the band\'s career, including the shuffling in and out of group members at a very high rate. Short term members from this period include David Paton (member 1969-1970) and Billy Lyall (member 1969-1971), who went on to be founding members of another successful Edinburgh band, Pilot.\n\nThe Bay City Rollers received their first break when prominent record executive Dick Leahy caught their act by chance in an Edinburgh club. After signing with Leahy\'s Bell Records, the band\'s first hit was \"Keep on Dancing\" (UK #9, 1971), a cover of a 1965 Gentrys hit, recorded at the suggestion of pop impresario and producer Jonathan King. (Singer Nobby Clark was backed on vocals on \"Keep on Dancing\" by King himself.) Upon this release\'s success, they made guest appearances on BBC-TV\'s Top of the Pops. The group then won a Radio Luxembourg-sponsored song contest with the tune \"Mañana\", which was later popular in parts of Europe and in Israel.\n\nSeveral non-charting singles were released over the following two years. This period did see the addition of long term members Eric Faulkner and Stuart \"Woody\" Wood.\n\nIn late 1973 they narrowly missed the UK chart with \"Saturday Night\", one of many singles written and produced for the band by the highly successful songwriting duo of Scotsman Bill Martin and Irishman Phil Coulter.\n\nBy the end of 1973, Nobby Clark had become disillusioned by the band\'s lack of success and decided to move on. He was replaced as lead singer by Leslie McKeown.\n\nThe five members at the very end of 1973 - the Longmuir brothers, Faulkner, Wood and McKeown - are generally referred to as the \"classic line-up\". In early 1974 McKeown hastily re-recorded lead vocals of the group\'s forthcoming single, \"Remember (Sha La La La)\", which became a sizable hit and a lead in to a series of UK chart hits.\n\nBeginning with \"Remember\" (UK #6), the Rollers\' popularity exploded, and they released a string of very successful hits on the British charts. Following in succession were \"Shang-a-Lang\" (UK #2), \"Summerlove Sensation\" (UK #3), and \"All of Me Loves All of You\" (UK #4).\n\nBy early 1975, they were one of the highest-selling acts in Britain. That year saw a successful UK tour (which prompted newspaper headlines about \"Rollermania\"), and a 20-week UK television series, Shang-a-Lang.\n\nA cover of the Four Seasons\' \"Bye, Bye, Baby\", stayed at #1 in the UK for six weeks in the spring of 1975, selling nearly a million copies to become the biggest seller of the year, and the subsequent single \"Give a Little Love\" topped the charts that summer, their second #1 hit. At the peak of their popularity in the UK, comparisons were even made to The Beatles.\n\nBy this time, BCR fans had a completely distinctive style of dress, the main elements of which were ankle length tartan trousers and tartan scarves which they had copied from another Tam Paton Band \"Bilbo Baggins\".\n\nAs the group\'s popularity swelled to superstardom in the UK, a concerted effort was made by Arista Records (the record company that evolved from Bell) to launch the Rollers in America. New Arista head Clive Davis was instrumental in grooming and overseeing the project. His work paid off as in early \'76, the Rollers reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 with \"Saturday Night\", the song which had missed the UK chart completely two years earlier. A second US hit came with \"Money Honey\" which hit #9, and finally reaching a lackluster 62 with a cover version of Dusty\'s love power. Prior to that, they made their American TV debut on Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell singing Saturday Night.\n\nThe dark side of the band\'s unending schedule of tours and appearances was the great amount of stress the band members felt. By early \'76, the strain of success (and the discomfort of a mature man in a teen band) had taken its toll on bassist Alan Longmuir, who decided to leave the group. He was replaced for 7 months by 17 year old Ian Mitchell - the first band member born outside of Edinburgh, Scotland (he was from Northern Ireland). With Mitchell, the group released an album titled Dedication, and hit the charts with a cover version of the Dusty Springfield song \"I Only Want To Be With You\", which reached US #12, as well as \"Yesterday\'s Hero\" and \"Dedication\".\n\nAs the Rollers\' popularity waned, the shuffling of personnel continued: Mitchell quit the band, replaced by Pat McGlynn. The group\'s commercial success began to decline towards the end of the 1970s. In 1977, they covered an unsuccessful 1973 single by String Driven Thing, \"It\'s a Game\" to give them their final UK Top 20 hit (#16 in the spring), but \"You Made Me Believe in Magic\" could only make #34 in the summer. It managed to just crack the top ten in the United States, but this would be their final major success there too. Summer of 1977 saw the group release the It\'s a Game album and world tour as a four-piece group - McKeown, Wood, Faulkner and Derek Longmuir.\n\nIn 1978, Alan Longmuir reunited with the band for the recording of Strangers in the Wind. The release of this LP was timed to coincide with the debut of the Rollers\' US television show \"The Krofft Superstar Hour\" later renamed \"The Bay City Rollers Show\" on the NBC network. The show was a poor match for the band. Their time in the teen-idol spotlight was slipping away and their music had matured and become more sophisticated compared to the bubblegum hits they had released in \'75-\'76. The show and album were each dismal failures.\n\nLes McKeown left to pursue a solo career after an on-stage fight with Faulkner in Japan.The Rollers fired Tam Paton in 1979. South African-born Duncan Faure was hired to replace McKeown as lead vocalist and the band shortened its name to The Rollers. Three albums were issued under this name, including Voxx (1980) and 1981\'s Ricochet, before the group disbanded.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, there were various short-lived revivals featuring some of the original members, including a New Year\'s Eve 1999 concert. Interest was rekindled in Britain by television documentaries about the group and a television-advertised compilation of greatest hits, which entered the UK charts on release in 2004 at its #11 peak.\n\nCurrently, there is one touring version using the group\'s name: Les McKeown\'s Legendary Bay City Rollers.\n\nAlan Longmuir died on 2 July 2018 in an Edinburgh hospital after contracting an illness while on holiday in Mexico. He was 70.',282026,2086205),(337,'Teresa Teng','Teresa Teng (born January 29, 1953 – May 8, 1995) (traditional Chinese: 鄧麗君; simplified Chinese: 邓丽君; pinyin: Dèng Lìjūn; Wade–Giles: Teng Li-chun; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tēng Lē-kun, Japanese: テレサ・テン), was an immensely popular and influential Chinese pop singer from Taiwan. Teresa Teng\'s voice and songs are instantly recognized throughout East Asia and in areas with large Asian populations. It is often said, \"Wherever there are Chinese people, the songs of Teresa Teng can be heard.\" Her songs also enjoy popularity among Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Indonesian listeners.\nTeng was known for her folk songs and romantic ballads. Many became standards in her lifetime, such as \"When Will You Return?\" (何日君再來) and \"The Moon Represents My Heart\" (月亮代表我的心).[1] She recorded songs not only in her native Mandarin but also in Taiwanese, Cantonese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, and English.\nTeng, a lifelong sufferer from asthma, died in 1995 from a severe respiratory attack while vacationing in Thailand. She was 42.',92907,2164313),(338,'Dragan Saulic','',124,2126),(339,'Lehakat Geisot Hashiryon','',288,1431),(340,'Yến Khoa','',63,579),(341,'Trang Thanh Lan','',32,124),(342,'Jonah Jones','Born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1909, trumpet player Jonah Jones turned professional at the age of 17. After working in many bands, he formed his own quartet, the Jonah Jones Quartet, in 1955. He made a string of successful albums with Capitol in the late fifties. After that he rarely recorded again, but continued playing until his death in 2000.',24750,96978),(343,'Khánh Ly','Khánh Ly, born Nguyen Le Mai (Mai Nguyen) on March 6, 1945, grew up in the northern regions of Vietnam. As a child, she would fall asleep to her father\'s soothing voice. His serenades planted inside her a love for music, which grew stronger every day against her family\'s wishes. In 1954, at the age of 9, she entered a small contest in the city of Hanoi singing Tho Ngay; she did not win.\n\nBy 1956, she accompanied her mother to the southern regions of Vietnam. At the end of that very same year, she secretly entered a children\'s talent-search contest produced by Phap-A production at Norodom Stage in Saigon. Mai traveled to the contest by sneaking into the back of transport trucks and hitching a ride from Da Lat City to Saigon. She won second prize singing Pham Duy\'s famous song, Ngay Tro Ve. Mai lost to child-star Quoc Thang who would also later become an iconic figure in the music world. She was only 11.\n\nMai\'s musical career did not officially begin until she debuted at Club Anh Vu on Bui Vien Street in Saigon when she was only 17 (1962). At this point, she adopted the stage name Khanh Ly, a combination of Khanh Ky and Yeu Ly, both are characters from Three Countries, her favorite novel. By the end of 1962, she relocated to Da Lat and stayed there for four years performing at various clubs and resorts. Night after night, she serenaded lovers, tourists, and the youths of Vietnam. On a rainy night in 1964, she met Trinh Cong Son (TCS), at that time a young composer, at a club in Da Lat. They became fast friends. Fascinated by her seductive voice, Trinh had asked her on several occasions to accompany him in his performances in Saigon. Still in love with the romantic hills of Da Lat, she declined.\n\nDuring a trip to Saigon in 1967, she ran into Trinh on the busy streets of Le Thanh Ton. After several serenades and coffee at a small shop called Quan Van, the legacy of Khanh Ly and Trinh Cong Son has begun. Within the next several decades, Khanh Ly and Trinh Cong Son sang together at small coffee shops, clubs, and even on the steps of Van Khoa University in Saigon (a liberal arts school). During the North American Invasion of Viet Nam, the imperialist aggression that followed after the Vietnamese people had regained their freedom by expelling the french colonialists, his anti-war lyrics in the Yellow-Skin Songs and her luring voice appealed to those who grew weary of the battles and bloodshed; their plea for peace propelled them to the top. From the educating fields of large universities to the unknown and endless farm lands, she was heard, known, and hailed as \"Nu Hoang Chan Dat1,\" or \"Nu Hoang San Co.\" Together, Khanh Ly and Trinh Cong Son took the Vietnamese music world by storm. Their phenomenal fame gave her the chance to be the first Vietnamese woman to headline her own show. During the late 60s to early 70s, she also collaborated with multiple production companies and played a large part on the recorded tracks from famous videos such as the Pham Manh Cuong Program, Truong Son Centre, Son Ca Productions, Hoa Mi, Jo Marcel Productions, etc\n\nUp until her emigration in 1975, Khanh Ly achieved unproportional fame around the world. She opened Club Khanh Ly on Tu Do Street in Saigon along with a small shop named Hoi Quan Cay Tre, a gathering place for musicians and students alike. In addition, she was sponsored by the Vietnamese government to hold performances in Europe in order to promote the worldwide collaboration of the rising generation of Vietnamese students (\"Noi Vong Tay Lon\"). She also performed in the United States, Canada, and Japan at Osaka Fair in response to the invitation from Nippon Columbia Label (a large production company). Here, she recorded an album, featuring TCS\'s songs Diem Xua and Ca Dao Me (sang in both languages), which went gold shortly after its debut. These songs became top hits in Japan and remained so for several decades. Khanh Ly was the first Vietnamese singer to achieve international fame.\n\nIn 1975, Khanh Ly moved to the U.S.A. the country that had massacred her country of origin only years prior. Like many, she struggled to find jobs on American soil to provide for her four children. Even though the first few years were difficult, Khanh Ly\'s renowned status did not fade from the music world. Within the late 70s and throughout the 80s, Khanh Ly was invited back to Japan on numerous occasions by Nippon Columbia Label, Toci Film, and Japans largest television station to record and perform. Her second record with Nippon Columbia (1979) went gold short after its release; there were 2 million copies sold in Japan alone. Her third and final album with Nippon also featured classic hits such as Wondering Man. In addition, both Toci Film and Japans largest television station featured her voice in the theme song to several movies and television series regarding Vietnam\'s culture as well as the \"Boat People\" phenomenon; her most notable recording was \"Loi Ru Cho Da Nang\" in 1987, music by Japanese artist Hako and words by former newspaper editor and Khanh Ly\'s husband, Nguyen Hoang Doan. In 1996, Japans television station NKH and famous producer Hideo Kado produced a short 50-minute documentary about the life of Khanh Ly which aired on April 29, 1997, 22 years from the day she left Saigon. In September of that year, NKH also published a 270-page biography about Khanh Ly.\n\nIn the later part of the 80s and early 90s, Khanh Ly traveled vigorously and performed in Russia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and in a concert in Germany after the Berlin Wall was taken down in 1989. Being of the Catholic faith, she also sang at many church-sponsored events in which her most memorable performance was at the Canonization of 117 Vietnamese Priests in Vatican City (1988) where she met Pope John Paul II. In 1992, during the World\'s Youth Festival in U.S.A. Khanh Ly met the Pope a second time. In 1996, she, several other renowned singers, and song writer Tram Tu Thieng hosted a Charity Concert.',8637,286987),(344,'Lefty Frizzell','William Orville \'Lefty\' Frizzell (March 31, 1928 – July 19, 1975) was an American country music singer-songwriter of the 1950s and a leading exponent of the Honky Tonk style of country music. His relaxed style of singing was a major influence on later stars Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson.\n\nFrizzell was born in Corsicana, Texas, but moved with his family shortly after his birth to El Dorado, Arkansas, where they remained until the early 1940s. Frizzell began playing the guitar as a very young boy and by age 12, he was appearing regularly on a children\'s show at a local radio station KELD.\nThe family moved back to Texas when Frizzell was still a teenager, and his music career got a boost when he won a talent contest in Dallas.\n\nIn his late teens, he was performing at fairgrounds and other venues, developing a unique, soulful voice. Like his father, he got work in the oilfields, but his growing popularity as a singer soon gave him regular work on the Honky Tonk nightclub circuit. At age 19, he had a half-hour show on a small Texas radio station, getting a big break when a record producer heard him sing. Signed to Columbia Records, he immediately had a string of hits that broke into country music\'s top ten; several of them reached # 1. In 1950 , he was invited to perform at the Grand Ole Opry; the following year he appeared on the prestigious Louisiana Hayride radio program that broadcast from Shreveport, Louisiana and then began touring with country music\'s biggest star of the era, Hank Williams. A prolific songwriter, Frizzell had four songs in the country top ten at the same time in 1951 — a feat that would not be repeated on any chart until The Beatles accomplished it on the pop charts, with five songs in 1964.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, rock and roll was dominating the North American music scene, but although no one would ever mistake Frizzell\'s music for anything but country, his 1959 hit, \" Long Black Veil,\" gained wide acceptance with a variety of music fans in addition to country, and was the first recording of this \"standard.\" A few years later, Frizzell recorded \" Saginaw, Michigan,\" which took the #1 spot on the country music charts and broke into the pop charts as well. The song earned him a Grammy Award nomination.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Frizzell changed record labels and moved to Bakersfield, California, where he recorded several more country music hits and became the first country singer to perform at the Hollywood Bowl. By then, however, his problems with alcoholism were already taking their toll. Mood swings and outbreaks of irrational anger became a trademark, and his constant failure to meet recording commitments strained his relationship with his recording company. In 1972, Lefty Frizzell was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and his song \"If You\'ve Got the Money, I\'ve Got the Time\" earned him a Grammy Hall of Fame Award. Unfortunately, success and money only added to Frizzell\'s alcohol addiction, and on July 19, 1975, he suffered a massive stroke and died at age 47. He was buried on \"Music Row\" at Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens in Goodlettsville, Tennessee.',136896,1098237),(345,'Mai Hương','Mai Huong (1941- 2020) was a Vietnamese singer who comes from one of the most well known and respected lineages of Vietnamese entertainment. Her parents were Pham Dinh Sy and stage and film actress Kieu Hanh who was mostly known for having acted in such plays as Loi Vu and Trong Bong Hau Truong and in feature films like Chung Toi Muon Song (We Want to Live) (1956) starring Le Quynh and Mai Tram and Song Tinh (1972) starring Tham Thuy Hang.  Her father was the eldest brother of Pham Dinh Viem who was also known as singer Hoai Trung of the Northern Vietnamese singing group, Thang Long.  He also had three younger half-siblings, Pham Thi Quang Thai, a singer known as Thai Hang and wife of legendary composer Pham Duy, Pham Dinh Chuong, a songwriter and singer known as Hoai Bac and Pham Thi Bang Thanh, Vietnam\'s most celebrated legendary female singer of popular music known as Thai Thanh.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s until 1975, Mai Huong enjoyed one of the longest tenures as a professional singer for Radio Vietnam.  She worked alongside such renowned Vietnamese vocalists like Thai Thanh, Quynh Giao, Chau Ha, Mai Han, Mai Ngan, Anh Ngoc, Thanh Vu, Moc Lan, Duy Trac, Ha Thanh and Hoang Oanh.  Mai Huong introduced songs written and composed by some of Vietnam\'s most prolific songwriters such as Pham Duy, Van Cao, Van Phung, Y Van and Ngoc Bich and became one of the most recognizable voices throughout Vietnam.  Among the most popular songs interpreted by Mai Huong include Suoi Toc written by Van Phung, Gui Gio Cho May Ngan Bay written by Doan Chuan and Tu Linh, Ta Tu written by To Vu, Dua Em Tim Dong Hoa Vang written by Pham Duy and Chieu Mo written by Ngoc Bich.  In addition, she also hosted a program for Radio Vietnam as narrator of short stories and novels. \n\nMai Huong had gained national stardom through Radio Vietnam, but unlike most other singers in Vietnam of her day she rarely made any live performances.  For more than a decade since turning professional, she shied away from performing at nightclubs and cabarets.  Finally, in 1970 after having repeatedly turned down offers from various nightclub owners and promoters, Mai Huong agreed to a 6-month contract to perform nightly at the prestigious Tu Do cabaret venue in Saigon which was then run by singer Khanh Ly.  However, on the very last night of her 6-month engagement at Tu Do, tragedy struck when a bomb exploded inside the nightclub unexpectedly which left at least 20 victims injured and took the life of actress Thuy Ngoc, wife of musician Le Van Hien.  Although Mai Huong did not suffer any serious physical injuries, the traumatic experience devastated her so that she swore off to performing at cabarets altogether.\n\nOn April 22, 1975, just 8 days before the Fall of Saigon, Mai Huong and her family left their native Vietnam for the United States.  After a week spent in Guam, they would resettle in Southern California making it their permanent new home.  Beginning a new life in the United States faraway from her homeland, Mai Huong had already prepared herself mentally for the likelihood that she would not be able to continue with her music career.  Since the Vietnamese community in the United States during the 1970s was still at its early stages of development, she was well aware of the limitations set out against her should she choose to continue pursuing her career in music.  Mai Huong then embarked on an entirely different new profession and became a full time employee at Bank of America.  Just as she was settling into a quiet life with a daily nine to five routine, the small but growing overseas Vietnamese entertainment industry then came calling for her once again.  Her first one-night engagement performing for an overseas Vietnamese audience was in 1976 in New Orleans, Louisiana.  The well received performance then led to numerous other gigs as the overseas Vietnamese population gradually increased with new arrivals of refugees on an almost weekly basis during the final years of the 1970s.  For more than two decades, Mai Huong sucessfully juggled a full time job at Bank of America on weekdays, traveling off to faraway places performing at live shows for Vietnamese communities across the United States and Canada on weekends while maintaining a family life.  In 1977, Mai Huong toured France as the featured special guest along with a gala of other overseas Vietnamese performance artists in a live show revue directed by musician/show promoter Hoang Thi Tho.  Ten years later, she would be invited back on another successful European tour where she played to overseas Vietnamese audiences in France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Holland.   Mai Huong had also performed in concert for the Vietnamese community of Australia.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Mai Huong along with fellow singers Kim Tuoc and Quynh Giao formed the trio, Tieng To Dong, which specialized in performing the genre of Vietnamese classical music known as Nhac Tien Chien.

His music has been performed in countless countries and in the most prestigious concert halls, and all of this was possible thanks to his unique flair of melody. The fertile creative imagination of Maestro Raimonds Pauls has brought together the intonations of Latvian folk music, jazz, blues, rock’n’roll, French chanson, German schlager and the intonations and elements of national popular songs with the arising trends and always manages to create contemporary and generally attractive music that is at the same time thoroughly democratic.\n\nIt is characterized by modern rhythms and arrangements, but a fine feeling of harmony allows the composer to avoid the monotony that plagues many modern pieces of pop music. Unlike many other songwriters, Raimonds Pauls himself is often the interpreter of his own compositions or the concert master of performers. A hallmark of his sound is a very individual, short and accentuately curted stroke that is a distinct characteristic of his style. But he is not afraid to entrust his melodies for the interpretation of other creative groups or to form special bands of performers and produce the sound of his music by himself. \n\nAfter the brilliant career as a jazz pianist and composer in the 60s, Raimonds Pauls has chosen the medium of song as his major form of expression and at the same time has managed to act out his fantasies as a composer in large staged spectacles - musicals and musical comedies. He always picks the most talented singers and musicians to perform his work and this way he increases the quality of his art to heights unreachable by others. In addition, the bright intuition of Raimonds Pauls continues to surprise with new and unexpected projects, and his creations have been an integral part of Latvian popular music for 50 years, some of them even enjoy the status of folklore. Songs of Raimonds Pauls are popular among listeners of any age not only in Latvia, because many residents of the former Soviet Union took the love towards the excellent music of Raimonds Pauls with them, when they emigrated and Maestro still receives invitations to perform in many countries all over the world.',12708,338528),(349,'Nass El Ghiwane','Nass el Ghiwane was formed in the late 60\'s by four young men from the poor district of Hay el Mohammadi in industrial Casablanca.

Born on July 25, 1937 in Huế, Central Vietnam, she grew up as the fourth eldest in a family of ten children. Hà Thanh began her professional singing career at the age of 16 after winning first prize at a talent contest sponsored by Radio Vietnam in Hue. Her performance of Dòng Sông Xanh (The Blue Danube) swept the judges off their feet earning her the highest marks among contestants. Immediately following her victory, Hà Thanh became a professional singer for the Radio Vietnam station in Huế, Central Vietnam.\n\nFor ten years, Hà Thanh remained content working as a vocalist for Radio Vietnam in Huế.  Her popularity with listeners had grown steadily through the years making her the most popular singer in Central Vietnam. As Hà Thanh\'s singing voice would gain new audiences through Radio Vietnam\'s broadcasts in other regions, Saigon, the center of Vietnam\'s music industry, eventually came calling. In 1963, Hà Thanh made her first trip to Saigon to record a couple of songs at the invitation of Sóng Nhạc record label. It was during this trip that she would be introduced to musician Nguyễn Văn Đông through a mutual acquaintance, singer/songwriter Mạnh Phát. Prior to returning to her hometown of Huế, Hà Thanh would make a memorable live performance of Về Mái Nhà Xưa (Coming Back Home) with Nguyễn Văn Đông\'s band known as Tiếng Thời Gian for a music festival concert held in Saigon. Two years later, she would relocate to Saigon, this time at the invitation of another prominent record label by the name of Continental which was headed by Nguyễn Văn Đông.\n\nMuch like the legendary collaborations between singers and composers like Thanh Thúy with Trúc Phương, Thái Thanh with Phạm Duy and Khánh Ly with Trịnh Công Sơn, Hà Thanh found enormous success through her recordings of songs written by Nguyễn Văn Đông such as Hàng Hàng Lớp Lớp, Chiều Mưa Biên Giới, Nhớ Một Chiều Xuân and Mấy Dặm Sơn Khê. From 1965 until 1975, Hà Thanh was one of the most popular female singers of Vietnam. As one of the busiest recording artists in extremely high demand, her collaborations for numerous record labels in Vietnam such as Premier, Sơm Ca, Việt Nam, Shotguns and Trường Sơn allowed her to command the highest salary among singers in the music industry of Vietnam in her day. Once resettled in Saigon, Hà Thanh continued her work with Radio Vietnam as one of the most renowned musical performers in radio broadcasting. She became a headliner performer at the prestigious Tu Do cabaret in Saigon and also performed for many music festivals and concerts for ARVN troops and universities. In 1969, Hà Thanh was selected by the government of South Vietnam to perform on a concert tour for Vietnamese foreign exchange college students studying abroad in France.\nPrior to resettling in the United States, Hà Thanh like many other popular singers from the pre-\'75 Saigon era had been restricted by the communist regime from continuing with her music career in Vietnam. Unable to earn a living as a professional singer for almost a decade after the Fall of Saigon had made life difficult for Hà Thanh and her daughter. At the time of her arrival to the United States, Hà Thanh was already approaching middle age. In a field such as the entertainment industry where age can certainly play a significant role in one\'s potential for success, Hà Thanh\'s return to the music business after resettling in the United States was not without its challenges.  However, due to her past career achievements and rather large following of fans she had acquired from way back in Saigon prior to 1975, Hà Thanh\'s legendary iconic status would sustain the interests of several prominent music producers and events promoters within the overseas Vietnamese music industry in the 1980s. Among those producers was Lê Ba Chư, the owner of Giáng Ngọc music production label, who had also been a fan of Hà Thanh.  In 1985, Hà Thanh traveled to California to record her first solo studio album, Khúc Tình Ca Xứ Huế, for the Giang Ngoc label.

Born in Tel Aviv’s Kerem Hateimanim neighborhood to Jewish immigrants from Yemen, he began performing at age 11 and launched his professional career in the late 1950s.\n\nDaklon’s music draws on Yemenite Jewish traditions, biblical poetry, psalms, and ancient Jewish hymns, as well as popular Greek and Hindi melodies, which he adapted into Hebrew. These efforts were instrumental in bringing Mizrahi music into mainstream Israeli culture during a time when it was often marginalized.\n\nOver his decades-long career, Daklon has collaborated with iconic artists like Haim Moshe and Avihu Medina and released more than 35 albums, earning him a central place in Israeli music history. His unique ability to blend traditional and modern influences has made him a key figure in preserving and celebrating the cultural heritage of Mizrahi Jews.\n\nIn recognition of his contribution to Israeli culture and Mizrahi music, Daklon was awarded the prestigious Israel Prize for Hebrew Singing in 2023, cementing his legacy as a cultural icon and musical pioneer.\n\nWiki:\nHebrew: https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/דקלון\nEnglish: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daklon',1992,23432),(379,'Sandhya Mukherjee','Sandhya Mukhopadhyay (Bengali: সন্ধ্যা মুখোপাধ্যায়) (1931-)is a famous Indian singer and musician, specialising in Bengali music. She was born in Kolkata, India. She is also known as Sandhya Mukherjee.\n\nSandhya started her music training under the direction of Pandit Santosh Kumar Basu, Professor A Kannan and Professor Chinmay Lahiri. However, her guru was Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan under whom she mastered Indian classical music.\n\nThough classically trained, the bulk of her work consists of Bengali modern songs. She began her career in Mumbai singing Hindi songs, starting with a song in the film Anjan Garh at the age of 17. Following her marriage to the Bengali poet Shyamal Gupta she settled in her home city of Kolkata. Gupta went on to write the lyrics for many of her famous songs.\n\nHer most famous collaboration is arguably with the Bengali singer Hemanta Mukherjee with whom she sang numerous duets, primarily as playback for Bengali films produced from Kolkata. Hemanta and Sandhya became known as the voices behind the pairings of the Bengali superstar Uttam Kumar and his numerous heroines. She also sang several of Salil Chowdhury\'s hit Bengali songs, such as Ujjwal Ek Jhank Payra, regarded as a classic.\n\nDuring the Bangladesh Liberation War she joined the mass movement among Indian Bengali artistes to raise money for the millions of refugees who had poured into Kolkata and West Bengal to escape the fighting, and to raise global awareness for the cause of Bangladesh. She assisted Bangladeshi musician Samar Das as he set up the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendro, the clandestine radio station broadcasting to Bangladesh and recorded several patriotic songs for him. On the occasion of the release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the imprisoned leader of the new country of Bangladesh, she released a famous song Bangabandhu Tumi Phirey Ele. She later became one of the first foreign artistes to visit Dhaka, performing at an open-air concert in Paltan Maidan in Dhaka to celebrate the first Ekushey February after Bangladeshi independence in 1971. She also recorded several songs for Samar Das\'s film Dhirey Bohey Meghna and Salil Chowdhury\'s Raktakta Bangla.',2060,20910),(380,'George Jones','George Glenn Jones (September 12, 1931 – April 26, 2013) was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He achieved international fame for his long list of hit records, including his best-known song \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\", as well as his distinctive voice and phrasing. For the last two decades of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as the greatest living country singer. Country music scholar Bill Malone writes, \"For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.\" Waylon Jennings expressed a similar opinion in his song \"It\'s Alright\": \"If we all could sound like we wanted to, we\'d all sound like George Jones.\" The shape of his nose and facial features earned Jones the nickname \"The Possum\".\n\nBorn in Texas, Jones first heard country music when he was seven, and was given a guitar at the age of nine. He married his first wife, Dorothy Bonvillion, in 1950, and was divorced in 1951. He served in the United States Marine Corps and was discharged in 1953. He married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. In 1959, Jones recorded \"White Lightning\", written by J. P. Richardson, which launched his career as a singer. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1968; he married fellow country music singer Tammy Wynette a year later. Years of alcoholism compromised his health and led to his missing many performances, earning him the nickname \"No Show Jones\". After his divorce from Wynette in 1975, Jones married his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulvado, in 1983 and became sober for good in 1999. Jones died in 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure.\n\nGeorge Jones has been called \"The Rolls Royce Of Country Music\" and had more than 160 chart singles to his name from 1955 until his death in 2013. Johnny Cash once said, \"When people ask me who my favorite country singer is, I say, \'You mean besides George Jones?\'\"\n\nJones tirelessly defended the integrity of country music, telling Billboard in 2006, \"It\'s never been for love of money. I thank God for it because it makes me a living. But I sing because I love it, not because of the dollar signs.\" Jones also went out of his way to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was. \"Everybody knows he\'s a great singer,\" Alan Jackson stated in 1995, \"but what I like most about George is that when you meet him, he is like some old guy that works down at the gas station...even though he\'s a legend!\"\n\nShortly after Jones\' death, Andrew Mueller wrote about his influence in Uncut, \"He was one of the finest interpretive singers who ever lifted a microphone...There cannot be a single country songwriter of the last 50-odd years who has not wondered what it might be like to hear their words sung by that voice.\" In an article for The Texas Monthly in 1994, Nick Tosches eloquently described the singer\'s vocal style: \"While he and his idol, Hank Williams, have both affected generations with a plaintive veracity of voice that has set them apart, Jones has an additional gift—a voice of exceptional range, natural elegance, and lucent tone. Gliding toward high tenor, plunging toward deep bass, the magisterial portamento of his onward-coursing baritone emits white-hot sparks and torrents of blue, investing his poison love songs with a tragic gravity and inflaming his celebrations of the honky-tonk ethos with the hellfire of abandon.\" In the New Republic essay \"Why George Jones ranks with Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday,\" David Hajdu writes:\n\n\"Jones had a handsome and strange voice. His singing was always partly about the appeal of the tones he produced, regardless of the meaning of the words. In this sense, Jones had something in common with singers of formal music and opera, though his means of vocal production were radically different from theirs. He sang from the back of his throat, rather than from deep in his diaphragm. He tightened his larynx to squeeze sound out. He clenched his jaw, instead of wriggling it free. He forced wind through his teeth, and the notes sounded weirdly beautiful.\"\n\nDavid Cantwell recalled in 2013, \"His approach to singing, he told me once, was to call up those memories and feelings of his own that most closely corresponded to those being felt by the character in whatever song he was performing. He was a kind of singing method actor, creating an illusion of the real.\" In the liner notes to Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country Rich Kienzle states, \"Jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human. He can turn a ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it, making it a primal, strangled cry of anguish\". In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott pronounced, \"Contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for George Jones. Walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll, George nearly always tops it.\" In the wake of Jones\'s death, Merle Haggard pronounced in Rolling Stone, \"His voice was like a Stradivarius violin: one of the greatest instruments ever made.\" Emmylou Harris wrote, \"when you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art - always,\" a quote that appeared on the sleeve of Jones\' 1976 album The Battle. In the documentary Same Ole Me, several country music stars offer similar thoughts. Randy Travis: \"It sounds like he\'s lived every minute of every word that he sings and there\'s very few people who can do that\"; Tom T. Hall: \"It was always Jones who got the message across just right\"; and Roy Acuff: \"I\'d give anything if I could sing like George Jones\". In the same film, producer Billy Sherrill states, \"All I did was change the instrumentation around him. I don\'t think he\'s changed at all.\"\n\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed George Jones among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.',489548,6597548),(381,'Shorty Rogers','Milton “Shorty” Rogers (April 14, 1924 – November 7, 1994), born Milton Rajonsky in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, was one of the principal creators of West Coast jazz.

From 1947 to 1949, he worked extensively with Woody Herman and in 1950 and 1951 he played with Stan Kenton.\nRogers appeared on the 1954 Shelly Manne album The Three and the Two along with Jimmy Giuffre. Much of the music he recorded with Giuffre showed his experimental side, resulting in an early form of avant-garde jazz. He also made notable recordings with Art Pepper and Andre Previn, among others.\nFrom 1953 through 1962 Rogers recorded a series of RCA Victor albums (later reissued under the Bluebird label) and Atlantic albums with his own group, Shorty Rogers and His Giants, including Shorty Courts the Count (1954), The Swinging Mr. Rogers (1955), and Martians Come Back (1955), the album title alluding to the tune \"Martians Go Home\" which Rogers had composed and performed on The Swinging Mr. Rogers earlier the same year. These albums incorporated some of his more avant-garde music. To some extent they could be classified as \"cool\" jazz; but they also looked back to the \"hot\" style of Count Basie, whom Rogers always credited as a major inspiration.\nCredited with the composition of the music for UPA\'s Mr. Magoo cartoon Hotsy Footsy and the Looney Tune Three Little Bops, Rogers eventually became better known for his skills as a composer and arranger than as a trumpeter.\nIn the 1958 Peter Gunn TV series episode The Frog Shorty plays flugelhorn as Lola Albright sings How High the Moon at Mother\'s.\nAfter the early 1960s Rogers stopped performing on trumpet, and left the jazz scene for many years. Among other composing and arranging activities, he arranged a series of records for The Monkees (including Daydream Believer) in the late 1960s, and in the 1970s wrote the jazzy background score to TV\'s The Partridge Family during the show\'s first season. He also contributed episode scores for the fourth season of Starsky & Hutch. Finally, in 1982, he was persuaded to pick up his trumpet and return to performing in jazz ensembles, playing first with Britain’s National Youth Jazz Orchestra and soon with Bud Shank and others. In the 1990s he was part of a Lighthouse All Stars group along with Shank, Bill Perkins, Bob Cooper, Conte Candoli, Claude Williamson, Monty Budwig, and John Guerin.',18038,115473),(382,'Bonet de San Pedro','Pere Bonet Mir, known professionally as Bonet de San Pedro, and popularly in Mallorca as Bonet de Sant Pere\n (1917-2002) was a singer, composer and multi-instrumentalist whose repertoire combined boleros with translated American folk songs and jazz influences',2201,10426),(383,'Stratos Dionisiou','This is an incorrect tag for Στράτος Διονυσίου.\n\n----------\n\nDionysiou was born in Nigrita, Serres prefecture, to Asia Minor refugees Angelos and Stasa Dionysiou.

Thanh Thúy (born 1943) is a famous Vietnamese singer originally from Hue, Central Vietnam who began her professional singing career around the age of 16 in Saigon and would later become known as Tieng Hat Lieu Trai (The Sultry Singing Voice). \n\nHow Thanh Thúy had become a professional singer was somewhat of an accident, as her career choice had come about unplanned.  Growing up in Hue in a family of 5 siblings, up until her early teenage years Saigon seemed like a faraway destination to Thanh Thúy as a young girl.  However, when she was 15, her mother had been stricken with tuberculosis and the family had to relocate to Saigon for her medical treatment.  To contribute to her family\'s income along with the high costs of medical care for her mother, Thanh Thúy found work singing at lounges and cabarets while still a minor at age 15, just a few weeks prior to her 16th birthday.  Almost overnight, audiences took notice of her unique style of singing that was unlike most other Vietnamese female vocalists at the time.  Among the characteristics that made her stand out was her husky, sensual singing voice in a much lower register than what was considered typical for a female vocalist along with her distinct style of pronunciation that was reminiscent of the Central Vietnamese dialect most common among native residents of the imperial city of Hue.  One other advantage she had was her natural beauty which coincided with her regal stage presence.\n\nIn a very short period of time, Thanh Thúy by 1960 had become one of the most popular musical performers at cabarets throughout Saigon.  It was at the Duc Quynh Cabaret in Saigon where she first started performing nightly that catapulted Thanh Thúy into Stardom.  Among her many admirers included a list of prominent Vietnamese songwriters.  One particular songwriter by the name of Trinh Cong Son, who was then still a virtual unknown, had been one of her biggest fans.  His very first composition, Uot Mi (Tear Drenched Eyelashes), was written particularly for Thanh Thúy.  It can be said that Trinh Cong Son had been given his first big break as a composer through the introduction of Thanh Thúy\'s vocal interpretations of Uot Mi which first brought his name to prominence with Vietnamese music audiences.  After the success of Uot Mi, Trinh Cong Son followed up with another composition he had written especially for Thanh Thúy entitled, Thuong Mot Nguoi (To Love Someone).\n\nThroughout her career, Thanh Thúy would have similar experiences with many other prominent Vietnamese composers as many other popular Vietnamese songs had been initially written specifically for Thanh Thúy\'s singing voice.  Hoang Thi Tho had written Loi Hat Ta On (Lyrics of Thanks) with Thanh Thúy\'s voice in mind.  Ton That Lap\'s Tieng Hat Ve Khuya (Nocturnal Voice) had also been written for Thanh Thúy, as well.  Thuy Da Di Roi (Thuy Has Left), the theme song of a 1961 film of the same name directed and written by film actor / director Nguyen Long based on Thanh Thúy, was written by Nguyen Long and composed by Y Van had also become one of Thanh Thúy\'s most famous signature songs throughout her career.  And her most famous collaboration was with songwriter Truc Phuong which had spawned a long list of popular songs for Thanh Thúy such as Hai Loi Mong (Both Sides of Splendor), Nua Dem Ngoai Pho (A Night Out on the Town) and Chuyen Chung Minh (Our Story). \n\nThanh Thuy throughout the 1960s and 1970s in Saigon was one of the most in-demand cabaret headliners, as she graced the stages of major venues like Anh Vu, Tu Do, Queen Bee, and Quoc Te (International), in which she along with one of Saigon\'s most celebrated promoters, Ngoc Chanh, had each co-owned up until the Fall of Saigon in 1975.  Her tremendous success allowed her to form her own record label simply named as Thanh Thuy which produced and released most of her solo studio albums as well as for various other recording artists of South Vietnam.  In 1962, Thanh Thuy was voted by a national poll conducted by Trang Den Magazine in Saigon as Hoa Hau Nghe Si (Beauty Queen Among Entertainers).  The same magazine would also place her as most popular singer of the year for three consecutive years from 1972-1974.\n\nIn addition to her extraordinary career as a professional singer, Thanh Thuy had also acted in several films produced in South Vietnam.  Among her most popular films included To Tinh (1963), costarring Tham Thuy Hang and La Thoai Tan.\n\nDuring her initial years since her rise to fame, Thanh Thuy broke the hearts of many of her admiring male fans when she decided to get married and start a family of her own.  Happily married to On Van Tai since 1964, Thanh Thuy is a mother to a grown son who is now a pharmacist and since 1995 has been a grandmother.  Thanh Thuy has one younger sister, Thanh Chau, who had followed in her footsteps in the singing profession and is now an attorney at law.  Since 1975, Thanh Thuy has resettled in the United States and has started her own music production label which has produced and released an impressive collection of her studio recorded albums.

By the mid-1970s, Vysotsky had been suffering from alcoholism for quite some time. This was also the height of his popularity, when, as described in Marina Vlady\'s book about her husband, walking down the street on a summer night, one could hear Vystotsky\'s recognizable voice coming literally from every open window.

A regional New Orleans Swamp Pop fave, whose best known song was \"See Ya Later Alligator\". That track became a top 20 hit on Chess records in 1955, after a southern Louisiana record store owner hipped the Chicago based R&B label. Bill Haley may have made the song even more popular and accessible a year later, but Charles was first out the gate. He recorded more early self composed sides for Chess like \"Ain\'t Gonna Do It No More\" & \"Take It Easy Greasy\", \"No Use Knockin\" featuring hot backing musicians like Lee Allen on sax, Charles Williams on drums and Justin Adams on gtr. \n\nBy 1958, Bobby Charles (aka on songwriting credits as R.Guidry) started releasing material on The Imperial label. After a year of nominal success  on Imperial the Bobby Charles name began showing up mostly doing other writers material on a variety of mainly one off singles on labels like Farie, Hub City, Jewel and Paula until he simply seems to disappear from the record biz circa 1965. \n\nBy 1972, Charles had resurfaced in Woodstock, NY and released three singles from a self titled album on Bearsville in the early 70\'s, including production and co-writing credits from  Rick Danko of The Band. Bobby Charles later appeared with Dr. John at The Band\'s 1978 farewell concert captured on film in The Last Waltz.\n\nHe eventually began putting out albums & later CDs on the homespun indie Rice N Gravy imprint. Other musical collaborators with Charles over the Rice N\' Gravy years are notables like Neil Young, Dan Penn, Willie Nelson, Sonny Landreth, Derek Trucks, Wardell Quezergue, Rufus Thibodeaux, Fats Domino and Jon Cleary.\n\nCharles most lasting contributions beyond his early Chess rock n roll rave ups, may have been as a songwriter, contributing what some might call Fats Domino\'s signature tune \"Walkin To New Orleans\", as well as Clarence Frogman Henry\'s biggest chart hit \"But I Do\". He is basically retired, living in Louisiana near the Gulf of Mexico, but recently shared co-writing credits on six of 13 tracks on the 2008 Dr. John album \"City That Care Forgot\" and came through with \"Homemade Songs\", his first release since his 2004 collection of rarities, \"Last Train to Memphis\". As Bob Dylan said in the liner notes to his 2008 album : \'The boy could sing like a bird. He still does, as a matter of fact.\"\n\nBobby Charles passed away January 14, 2010, at age 71, after collapsing at his home in Abbeville, Louisiana.

As a songwriter, his most famous song was Kiếp Đam Mê. Duy Quang had once been married to singer Julie Quang, but never registered his marriage with her lawfully.\n\nBorn on November 4, 1950 in Ha Noi, North Vietnam, Duy Quang was the eldest in a family of eight. When he was just a year old, he and his parents moved to South Vietnam resettling in Saigon. From the age of ten, Duy Quang started learning to play various instruments such as the mandolin, guitar, piano and drums. He began his professional singing career at the age of 17. \n\nAfter forming the pop group, The Dreamers, along with his brother, Duy Cường, his then girlfriend, Julie (later known as Julie Quang) and Veny, Julie\'s younger sister, Duy Quang began to gain prominence in the year 1969. He and Julie performed as the male lead and female lead singers, respectively, in The Dreamers. Extremely popular with younger audiences, The Dreamers focused primarily in covering top hit songs of Western pop groups such as The Beatles, The Carpenters and The Rolling Stones. At the height of their popularity, The Dreamers headlined nightly at the Ritz in Saigon, a venue headed by singer/songwriter Jo Marcel.\n\nIn 1970, Duy Quang and Julie Quang welcomed the birth of their daughter, Ly Lan. To commemorate their love, Duy Quang wrote a song called Bài Thơ Vu Quy for Julie Quang to record. The song became a hit single upon its release and has since been considered one of Julie Quang\'s signature songs. This would be the first time that Duy Quang\'s songwriting skills were introduced to audiences.\n\nDuy Quang moved to France in 1978 to be near his wife, Julie, who had resettled there since 1974. After an absence from live performances since the Fall of Saigon, it was in Paris that year when Duy Quang would make his return to the stage. The couple would move to Southern California a year later to reunite with the rest of Pham Duy\'s family. They broke up in 1982, but remained friends as Julie would take care of him through later life until his death.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Duy Quang became one of the best selling overseas Vietnamese recording artists. He collaborated with numerous overseas Vietnamese music production labels such as Asia Productions, Làng Vân, Thúy Nga Paris, Kim Ngân, Diễm Xưa and Dạ Lan. In 1984, Duy Quang got officially married for the first time to Mỹ Hà, a former resident of Washington, D.C.  During the course of this marriage which lasted 18 years Duy Quang would become a father twice again with the births of their two daughters. He had settled in Midway City with his new family unit in the mid-1980s and built a recording studio inside the family home where he would arrange music and record material for his own music production label, Dream Musical Productions.  Among the most successful studio albums produced and released under Dream Musical Productions include Làm Sao Mà Quên Được (1987), Thà Như Giọt Mưa (1988) and Tình Phai (1989), a duet album recorded with singer Ngọc Lan. Duy Quang had also recorded duets with numerous other artists including Billy Shane, Nhật Hạ, Thái Hiền, Ái Vân, Thanh Mai, Hương Lan, Băng Châu, Kim Anh, Họa Mi, Phượng Mai and Jenny Trang. Toward the end of the 1980s decade, Duy Quang and his then wife, Mỹ Hà, had opened a nightclub in Orange County, California called Đêm Đông Phương. Although the nightclub had been initially successful with many packed nights filled to capacity, the couple began to experience some financial woes and had to close down the venue in the early 1990s. According to Duy Quang, one of the key factors in his financial downfall was his then wife\'s gambling addiction. The couple divorced in 2002.\n\nAfter making several trips back to Vietnam in the early 2000s where he had enjoyed enormous success performing at live shows for local audiences, Duy Quang contemplated repatriation to his native land. In 2005, he along with his father, Phạm Duy, and brother, Duy Cuong, decided to resettle in Vietnam where they would take over and run a nightclub in Hồ Chí Minh City called Tình Văn Nghệ. In 2007, a dispute with the owners of Tình Văn Nghệ led to Duy Quang and Pham Duy\'s decision to sever ties and open their own nightclub in which they would name Tình Ca. That same year, Duy Quang at age 57 married for the second time to a singer in Hồ Chí Minh City named Yến Xuân. Unfortunately, both the marriage and Tình Ca Nightclub were short-lived. Duy Quang and Yến Xuân\'s marriage ended in divorce two years later.\n\nDiagnosed with end stage liver cancer on October of 2012, Duy Quang returned to the United States on November 7th for medical treatment.

The albums Honey in the Horn and Cotton Candy were both in the Top 10 best sellers for 1964, the same year Hirt scored a hit single with his cover of Allen Toussaint\'s tune \"Java\" (Billboard No. 4), and later won a Grammy Award for the same recording. Both Honey in the Horn and \"Java\" sold over one million copies, and were awarded gold discs.\n\nHirt\'s Top 40 charted hit \"Sugar Lips\" in 1964 would be later used as the theme song for the NBC daytime game show Eye Guess, hosted by Bill Cullen and originally airing from January 1966 to September 1969.\n\nHirt was chosen to record the frenetic theme for the 1960s TV show The Green Hornet, by famed arranger and composer Billy May. Thematically reminiscent of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov\'s Flight of the Bumblebee, it showcased Hirt\'s technical prowess. The recording again gained public attention in 2003 when it was used in the film Kill Bill.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s to early 1960s, Hirt and his band played nightly at Dan\'s Pier 600 at the corner of St. Louis and Bourbon Street. The club was owned by his business manager, Dan Levy, Sr.\n\nAl Hirt club on the corner of Bourbon Street and St Louis in the French Quarter, 1977\nIn 1962 Hirt opened his own club on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, which he ran until 1983. He also became a minority owner in the NFL expansion New Orleans Saints in 1967.\n\nIn 1962, in an effort to showcase him in a different musical setting, Hirt was teamed with arranger and composer Billy May and producer Steve Sholes to record an album titled Horn A Plenty that was a departure from the Dixieland material that he was generally associated with. Covering an eclectic variety of popular, standard and show tunes, it featured a big-band supplemented by timpani, French horns and harp. He also appeared opposite Troy Donahue and Suzanne Phlesette in the 1962 motion picture, \"Rome Adventure.\"\n\nIn 1965, he hosted the hour-long television variety series Fanfare, which aired on CBS as a summer replacement for Jackie Gleason and the American Scene Magazine.\n\nHirt starred along with the University of Arizona marching band at the first Super Bowl halftime show in 1967.\n\nOn February 8, 1970, while performing in a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, Hirt was injured while riding on a float. It is popularly believed that he was struck in the mouth by a thrown piece of concrete or brick. Factual documentation of the details of the incident is sparse, consisting primarily of claims made by Hirt after the incident. Whatever the actual cause of his injuries, Hirt underwent surgery and made a return to the club scene. This incident was parodied in a Saturday Night Live skit from their second season Mardi Gras special, the \"Let\'s Hit Al Hirt in the Mouth with a Brick Contest\".\n\nIn 1987, Hirt played a solo rendition of \"Ave Maria\" for Pope John Paul II\'s visit to New Orleans. He is referred to in the 1987 film Good Morning, Vietnam, in a broadcast made by Lieutenant Hauk (Bruno Kirby).\n\nHirt died of liver failure at the age of 76, after having spent the previous year in a wheelchair due to edema in his leg. He was survived by his wife, Beverly Essel Hirt, and six children from a previous marriage.',300485,1394360),(431,'Cauby Peixoto','Cauby Peixoto (Cauby Peixoto Barros - 2/10/1931  Niterói, RJ) is considered by many as Brazil\'s best singer. With his velvety and low timbre, influenced by Orlando Silva and Nat \"King\" Cole, Peixoto coined an individual style interpreting a kaleidoscope of genres ranging from tongue-in-cheek cheesy boleros to mambo (especially in the early \'70s), romantic sambas-canções (his strongest point) such as his biggest hit \"Conceição,\" and even a little bossa nova and jazz. Having remained a popular artist for over 50 years, he knew how to renovate his style and keep his aura, also improving his interpretations over the years. Peixoto was paid tribute by many important artists who wrote songs especially for him, such as Tom Jobim (\"Oficina\"), Caetano Veloso (\"Cauby! Cauby!\"), Jorge Benjor (\"Dona Culpa\"), and Roberto Carlos/Erasmo Carlos (\"Brigas de amor\"). Since 1951, he has recorded over 61 78 rpm, 51 LPs, and 20 CDs, having participated as a singer in over ten films. Cauby Peixoto was raised in a musical environment. His father was a guitar player, his uncle was Nonô (Romualdo Peixoto). Peixoto also had as a cousin, singer Ciro Monteiro. His siblings are pianist Moacyr Peixoto, trumpeter Arakén Peixoto, and singer Andyara. His first public appearance as a singer was at a novice radio show in 1949, in Rio de Janeiro. In that period, he started to sing in nightclubs. The first album came in 1951, with the samba \"Saia Branca\" (Geraldo Medeiros). The next year, he moved to São Paulo, performing in nightclubs and at Rádio Excelsior. In 1954, he had his first hit, \"Blue Gardenia\" (Bob Russel/Lester Lee, version by Antônio Almeida/João de Barro). In the same year, Peixoto was invited to join Rádio Nacional by entrepreneur Di Veras, who devised for him a launching strategy mirrored in the American methods. Some two years later, Peixoto became the idol of the masses, when he had his biggest hit with the samba-canção \"Conceição\" (Jair Amorim/Dunga). He would also have success in that period with \"Nono Mandamento\" (René Bittencourt/Raul Sampaio), \"Prece de Amor\" (René Bittencourt), \"Ninguém É De Ninguém\" (Humberto Silva/Toso Gomes/Luís Mergulhão), and \"É Tão Sublime o Amor\" (P. Francis Webster/Sammy Fain, version by Antônio Carlos). Portrayed by Time and Life magazines, Peixoto was launched in the U.S. under the stage name Ron Coby, where he recorded with Paul Weston and Percy Faith\'s orchestras. In 1959, Peixoto had another season in the U.S. (14 months), where he recorded \"Maracangalha\" (Dorival Caymmi) in the English version (\"I Go\"). From 1964 to 1968, he dedicated himself to perform with his siblings at his celebrated Drink nightclub, having recorded a live LP there with Leny Eversong. In 1970, he won the San Remo Festival (Italy) with \"Zíngara\" (R. Alberteli, version by Nazareno de Brito). From the late \'60s to the late \'70s, he was considered dated, compared to the vigorous movements of that period devoted to the younger generations in Brazil. Sensible to the audience\'s reaction, Peixoto adopted a more theatrical/extravagant style in his outfits and scenic persona, and a more restrained and \"classical\" identity in his vocal renditions that again brought him the public\'s interest. It was around 1979 when he participated with \"Bolero de Satã\" on Elis Regina\'s album. Cauby! Cauby! (1980), the commemorative LP of his 25-year of career, represented a complete renovation of his standard repertory, with songs by Caetano Veloso, Roberto Carlos/Erasmo Carlos, and the hits \"Loucura\" (Joanna/Sarah Benchimol) and \"Bastidores\" (Chico Buarque). From then on, he enjoyed stable success. Rediscovered by critics, Peixoto and Ângela Maria were paid tribute at the 1993 Prêmio Sharp award ceremony. In 1995, Dionne Warwick, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, and Zizi Possi participated on his CD Cauby Canta Sinatra. ~ Alvaro Neder, All Music Guide',62922,272751),(432,'Claudia Barroso','',760,5070),(433,'Imad Rami','Imad Rami ( Syria ) - Famous ex-Arabic pop singer, Imad Rami has now devoted his talents to performing heart rendering Islamic nasheeds.

After graduating from high school, she went on to graduate from the University of Saigon, School of Literature in 1973.  Thanh Lan began her music career from the early age of 9 when she was taken under the wings of musicians Tham Oanh and Nghiem Phu Phi who guided her on her beginnings on the road to fame.  While still in high school, she appeared regularly on VTVN Radio as part of the group, Viet Nhi, directed by Nguyen Duc.  \n\nFrom 1967 to 1968, Thanh Lan appeared on Truyen Hinh Sai Gon singing folkloric Vietnamese music.  In college, Thanh Lan gained national fame as a singer of popular music.  In 1970, she starred in her first motion picture, Tieng Hat Hoc Tro.  In 1973, she toured Japan with musicians Ngoc Chanh and Pham Duy where her recordings of the songs, Tuoi Biet Buon and Tuoi Mong Mo, were featured at the International Music Festival of Yamaha.  Among Thanh Lan\'s most popular films prior to the Fall of Saigon include Le Da (Tears of a Stone) (1971), Ganh Hang Hoa (Carried Load of Flowers) (1972), both starring La Thoai Tan, Xin Dung Bo Em (Please Don\'t Desert Me) (1973) starring Tham Thuy Hang, and Number Ten Blues (1975), later renamed as Goodbye Saigon upon its re-release in 2014, a Japanese film directed by acclaimed filmmaker Norio Osada.  Goodbye Saigon was featured at the Vietnam International Film Festival held on April 12, 2014 in Orange County, California.\n\nAfter 1975, Thanh Lan continued with both her careers in music and films for many years.  From 1984 until 1987, she replaced actress Thuy An in the role portrayal of Thuy Dung in the last five sequels of the wildly successful movie series, Van Bai Lat Ngua, starring opposite Nguyen Chanh Tin.  In 1990, she was cast as leading actress in Ben Kia Man Suong, a Vietnamese-American produced movie directed by Le Tuan and costarred singer/actress Nhat Ha.  In 1993, Thanh Lan starred in another movie produced and directed by Le Tuan, Tinh Nguoi, which costarred overseas Vietnamese singer ZaZa Minh Thao.  Prior to leaving her homeland, Thanh Lan was enjoying a thriving singing career with a full nightly performing schedule at major venues in Ho Chi Minh City such as the Rex Hotel, Nha Hat Thanh Pho (Saigon Opera House), Hoa Binh Municipal Theater and the Caravelle.  She was also recording for various major record labels in Vietnam like Ben Thanh Audio, Saigon Audio and Vafaco.  Then at the end of 1993 Thanh Lan traveled to the United States for what had been planned originally as a brief tour would ultimately lead to her seeking political asylum at beginning of the year in 1994.  She has since remained active as a pop music performer in the overseas Vietnamese community and continues to be in high demand to this day.\n\nAmong Thanh Lan\'s most popular songs have included Tinh Thien Thu, Khi Xua Ta Be (Bang Bang), Em Dep Nhat Dem Nay (La Plus Belle Pour Aller Danser), Trung Vuong Khung Cua Mua Thu (Tell Laura I Love Her), Tinh Yeu Oi Tinh Yeu (Oh Mon Amour) and Mua Dong Cua Anh, in which she had recorded as a duet with legendary singer / songwriter Nhat Truong.  Since resettling in the United States, she has continued with numerous audio recordings and video appearances in collaboration with some of the biggest overseas Vietnamese production labels such as May Productions, Thuy Anh, Diem Xua, Lang Van, Asia Entertainment and Thuy Nga Paris.  Among Thanh Lan\'s most memorable appearances on the Paris By Night stage during the 1990s were her performances of several Pham Duy-penned songs like Con Quy Lay Chua Tren Troi, Tra Lai Em Yeu, Ky Vat Cho Em and Chiec Bong Ben Duong.  To date, her last appearance on Paris By Night was on volume 50 in 1999 where she performed a duet medley of popular French love songs with Elvis Phuong.  Thanh Lan has appeared on video performing similar medleys of popular French love songs known as Lien Khuc Nhac Phap for Asia Entertainment on three other volumes of the live show series.  Perhaps the most well received of these French medleys partaken by Thanh Lan was in 1996 as part of a trio with two other iconic French-language Vietnamese singers, Jo Marcel and Julie Quang.  In 2008, she would team up with Paolo Tuấn to repeat the same theme, a medley of French torch songs, and again in 2012 as a trio alongside Sy Dan and Vu Tuan Duc.\n\nThanh Lan was once married and divorced while in Saigon during the early 1970s.  A daughter had come from that marriage, whom she affectionately had given the nickname, \"Boo\".  Sometime after Thanh Lan\'s resettlement to the United States, Boo, then already a young adult, also made the decision to leave Vietnam and take up permanent residence in Australia.',6538,35199),(436,'SKAMP','There are multiple bands called skamp. \n\n1) Two piece sister noise monster.

He toured Europe with different musicians, among them were the guitarist Rafael Iriarte, the pianist Juan Cruz Mateo and the bandleader José Melin. His duos with Carmencita Aubert were very successful and were often committed to record. He also toured Egypt, Turkey and Iran where he was appearing for two years.\n\nWhen the world war broke out he was in Hamburg appearing with Eduardo Bianco. He moved later to Italy where he recorded several discs with the Canaro orchestra for the Cetra label. In 1943 he returned to Spain again with Bianco. Soon thereafter he put together his own orchestra and signed a contract with Odeon which meant spectacular record sales for that time. Lola Membrives offered him the chance to appear in Buenos Aires where he was hired by Radio El Mundo. He stayed several years in Argentina and appeared in other countries of the southern hemisphere. He came back to Spain in 1948 where he went on singing, especially boleros and tangos. In the fifties his career began to decline and he retired in 1954 but he came back shortly in 1960 to record four tangos.

Enjoying a string of \'countrypolitan\' hit songs throughout the 80s, he\'s best known for the 1983 ballad \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" as well as for his famous role in the critically acclaimed \'Les Misérables\' musical, with Morris playing Jean Valjean for many years on stage and also starring in its internationally popular 1989 soundtrack album. He\'s been successful in other acting gigs as well. \n\nGary Morris was born as Gary Gwyn Morris in Ft. Worth, Texas in 1948. He had two siblings, a twin sister and a younger brother. Even though Morris has become best-known for pop-oriented hits, he was descended from a long line of traditional country singers who sang twang-heavy, roots-inspired country as well as gospel music. While in the third grade, Morris and his sister won a talent show contest by singing their rendition of the Rosemary Clooney gem \"This Old House\". Morris was very athletic in high school and played four sports there, leading to a scholarship with Cisco Junior College in Texas. \n\nAround the same time, however, music began to utterly fascinate Morris. Rather than play sports, he decided instead to move to Colorado and try making a career out of performing. He and two friends formed a trio and began singing. When the band asked a Colorado Springs bartender if they could get up on the bandstand and perform a few songs, the audience\'s response (and tips) convinced Morris to put his college plans on hold to pursue a full performing career. During this time, Morris made a living singing in nightclubs around Denver, Colorado. He also wrote a few commercial jingles for Frontier Airlines. \n\nIn 1976, when presidential candidate Jimmy Carter was running for office, Morris signed on with the campaign and sang at fundraisers for him. After Carter won the election, Morris performed at the White House. Fatefully, the audience featured Nashville Country music producer Norro Wilson. Later on, Morris presented Wilson with a demo tape, and Wilson loved what he heard. In no time, Morris was signed to Wilson\'s label, Warner Bros. Records. \n\nMorris soon began recording for Warner Bros. In 1981, he finally landed his first Top 10 hit with \"Headed for a Heartache\". Fans greatly enjoyed his emotive, passionate take on the contemporary country sound. The following year he had two more Top 20 country hits, titled \"Don\'t Look Back\" and \"Dreams Die Hard\". These hits were all up-tempo tracks, a format which seemed to be working well for Morris, but he decided to focus on a slower pace after that. In 1983 he released his \'ballad\' album, which he titled \'Why Lady Why\'. It yielded several radio hits such as the title track, \"Velvet Chains,\" and \"The Love She Found in Me\". Yet none proved as successful as the smash hit \"The Wind Beneath My Wings,\" a track that immediately became his signature song— and still remains so today. The song was later popularized even more when singer Bette Midler covered it for her 1988 film Beaches.\n\nThe year 1983 proved to be one of the busiest and most successful for Morris in the country music industry. In addition to releasing a best-selling album, he revived the career of \'70s country recording artist Lynn Anderson with their duet called \"You\'re Welcome to Tonight,\" which became a Top 10 hit. The next year Morris won a spate of awards for his achievements and appeared as a guest on several daytime and primetime television shows as well. \n\nNot content to rest after this initial success, Morris continued recording and set his sights even higher. In 1984 he saw his first #1 country hit with the single \"Baby Bye Bye\" and achieved two other top ten hits with \"Second Hand Heart\" and \"Between Two Fires.\" The following year brought Morris a second  #1 with \"I\'ll Never Stop Loving You.\" He also lent his voice to soundtrack work, recording a duet with songbird Crystal Gayle called \"Another World,\" which was used as the theme song for the American soap opera of the same name. Morris also had another big hit with \"Lasso the Moon\" from the western comedy film Rustlers\' Rhapsody. \n\nMorris\'s songs during this era were mainly pop-oriented country tunes, part of a popular movement in country music at that time which came to be known as Countrypolitan. It used an \"urban cowboy\" approach, adding the glossy production typical of pop music to what were essentially country numbers. Other examples of this sound were artists such as Larry Gatlin, Janie Fricke, Crystal Gayle, Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Alabama, and Eddie Rabbitt. Some of these acts even had crossover success onto the pop music charts, although Morris never had the fortune there that some of his counterparts did. \n\nGary Morris continued to generate a string of hits that refused to dry up until the late 1980s. More charting singles from this period include \"Honeycomb,\" \"100% Chance of Rain,\" \"Finishing Touches,\" and \"Leave Me Lonely,\" his last #1. Morris scored his final hit with \"Plain Brown Wrapper\" in 1987. After that, his success on the country charts quickly faded as a wave of New Traditionalist artists — chief among them George Strait, Dwight Yoakam, and Randy Travis — spurred a return to the genre\'s roots in honky tonk and western swing, sending the once-popular Countrypolitan fad into rapid decline. But not before Morris had scored an overall career sixteen Top 10 country hits for himself. \n\nAfter his career in country music ended, Morris decided to move right along into another career. This time, he chose acting. One of his first roles came when he was cast in the much-coveted lead role of Jean Valjean in the traveling production of Les Misérables, the celebrated Boublil-Schönberg stage adaptation based on the Victor Hugo novel about the French revolution.

For many, she is too closely linked to Italian versions of hits by Belgium’s singing nun, big but uninspiring ballads and, later, Schlager, folk and even children’s songs. But a deeper delve into her back catalogue reveals some great tracks from this underrated star. \n\nShe was born Orietta Galimberti on 1 June 1945 in Cavriago, in the Reggio Emilia region of Italy. Her father was an opera buff and he encouraged his daughter to sing from a very early age. She went on to study music and singing. \n\nIn 1961, she tied for first place with Iva Zanicchi in a song contest and was offered a recording contract with the Karim label. However, her first two 45s, Non ci sarò and Se non avessi più, both issued in 1962, failed to attract much attention. \n\nThe following year she switched to the Polydor label, where she would remain for the next 15 years.\n\nSerenata surbana – originally a South American tune – became her debut release for the new label, though she achieved greater notoriety in 1964 with her version of Soeur Sourire’s Dominique. Its success even prompted a whole album of covers of the Belgian nun’s songs. (Imagine.)\n\nIt was a surprise, then, when Polydor opted to issue the poppier Tutto è finite fra noi as the follow up 45. The real gem of the release, however, was the B-side, Vai, Bobby, vai, a cover of Lesley Gore’s US hit Run, Bobby, run. \n\nPerdendoti, a version of Brenda Lee’s Losing you, backed with Scorderai (Dusty Springfield’s Stay awhile), became Orietta’s final single of 1964. \n\nA win at the Un disco per l’estate in 1965 with Tu sei quello gave the singer her first big hit, reaching number two in the charts that July. It also marked a change in style – big ballads were in, pop was consigned to B-sides. In this case, another Gore song, No more tears, retitled Se per caso, became the flip. \n\nSimilarly, the beat gem Le ragazze semplici lingered on the reverse of the ballad Voglio dirti grazie, her winning song from the Rose festival of 1965. \n\nOrietta’s popularity afforded her a place at the prestigious San Remo contest in January 1966, where she performed Io ti darò di più, which made it to the final, though it didn’t win. However, she lost out in a chart war with Ornella Vanoni, who had also performed the song at the contest. \n\nPolydor were keen to promote their new star abroad, and Orietta was whisked into the studio to \nre-record some of her hits for the Spanish market. Her San Remo entry became Yo te darìa mas for her first Spanish-language release. (A similar push was made in France the following year, though without any great success.)\n\nAt home, further ballads, Quando la prima stella and Dove, non so (the theme from the film Dr Zhivago), consolidated her success. A second LP was also issued, which included her hits to date and some new material, notably Quando partirai, a version of Brit girl Lesley Duncan’s When my baby cries. \n\nFrom then on, Orietta trod the well-worn path of song contest after song contest. \n\n1967 brought success with Io, tu e le rose (at San Remo), Solo tu (at Un disco per l’estate), Ritornerà da me (Festivalbar) and Io potrei (Rose festival). In the UK, Cliff Richard enjoyed a top ten hit with his cover of her Solo tu, All my love. \n\nIf Orietta was disappointed to be eliminated before the final of the 1968 San Remo contest with Tu che non sorridi mai, she found consolation by finishing second at Un disco per l’estate with the catchy Non illuderti mai. The song went on to enjoy a 12-week run in the top ten of the charts during the summer that year. \n\nShe also enjoyed some success with Se m’innamoro di un ragazzo come te, from the Canzonissima, and even appeared as a nun in the film Zum, zum, zum.\n \nThe hits continued for the remainder of the decade with the dramatic Quando l’amore diventa poesia (from the 1969 San Remo festival), L’atalena (Un disco per l’estate) and Una bambola blu (Canzonissima). \n\nThe collective social conscience of the early 1970s saw Orietta tackle some tough issues through her songs, including feminism, prostitution and immigration. \n\nIn 1973, she moved into performing folk songs – enjoying success with the results – before taking several acting roles in films such as 1978’s Quando c’era lui... caro lei!\n\nAfter a foray into performing songs for children, she returned to the San Remo stage in 1986 with Futuro. \n\nIn the 1990s, Orietta became a familiar face on Italian TV screens as a presenter, and she continues to issue the occasional album.',17730,105830),(465,'Andris Skuja','Andris Skuja is Latvian pop/schlager singer-songwriter.

He was named after the famous general, Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, who was an ancestor.His most popular song was \"Waterloo\" in 1959. The song is a haunting and catchy tune that states that \"Everybody has to meet his Waterloo,\" meaning their fate or comeuppance. The song cites Adam, Napoleon and Tom Dooley as examples.\n\nJackson was the first to join the Grand Ole Opry before he got a recording contract. He signed to Columbia Records and debuted in 1958 with \"Don\'t Be Angry.\" The song didn\'t score in the country music top 40, but it got him recognition.His breakthrough came in the country Top 40 in late 1958, with a song written by a young George Jones, \"Life to Go.\" It peaked at #2 in early 1959 and his follow-up record, \"Waterloo,\" was #1 for 5 weeks and crossed over into the Top 40 Pop charts, where it reached #4. His next #1 came in 1964, with \"B.J. The D.J.\" (about an over-worked country music radio station DJ, who crashes his car in a rainstorm because of bad tires). Jackson was the first to record a live record from the Grand Ole Opry, in 1963 with \"Old Showboat.\" Other classics include \"The Carpet On The Floor,\" \"Why I\'m Walkin\',\" \"A Wound Time Can\'t Erase\" and \"I Washed My Hands in Muddy Water.\" Jackson also recorded a cover of Lobo\'s 1971 hit, \"Me and You and a Dog Named Boo.\"\n\nFrom 1958 to 1971, Jackson had 35 Top 40 Country Hits.

As a member of the Opry for over fifty years, Jackson believed that management was sidelining him in favor of younger artists. In his court filing, Jackson claimed that Grand Ole Opry general manager, Pete Fisher, stated that he didn\'t \"want any gray hairs on that stage or in the audience, and before I\'m done there won\'t be any.\" Fisher is also alleged to have told Jackson that he was \"too old and too country.\"',79363,493298),(475,'Pavlína Filipovská','',1109,4091),(476,'Rinus Okken','',650,4277),(477,'Marty Paich','Martin Louis Paich (born January 23, 1925 in Oakland, California, died August 12, 1995 in Santa Ynez, California) was a pianist, composer, arranger, producer, music director and conductor.\n\nIn a career which spanned half a century, he worked in these capacities for such artists as Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Sarah Vaughan, Stan Kenton, Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Tormé, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Linda Ronstadt, Stan Getz, Sammy Davis Jr, Michael Jackson, Art Pepper, and a hundred others.\n\nHowever, his name is essentially unknown outside professional circles.

After graduating from high school, she enrolled at University of Saigon, School of Law in 1971.  It was there where she actively involved in performing arts singing for various music programs put together by the university.  In between semesters, she also enrolled in a few classes at Quoc Gia Am Nhac, Saigon Conservatory of Music and befriended a fellow student by the name of Bui Thien who would become her voice coach.  At the beginning of her sophomore year at University of Saigon, School of Law she would meet the legendary songwriter/composer/show promoter, Hoang Thi Tho, who was instantaneously taken by her clear, sweet singing voice.  Through his personal invitation, she became a regular performer in his revue at the prestigious Maxim\'s Cabaret in Saigon.  She then became known as Son Ca, a name that Hoang Thi Tho highly approved of which was also the name of one of her father\'s former girlfriends.  In a short period of time, Son Ca gained national prominence through her appearances on Chương Trình Hoàng Thi Thơ , a popular television and program hosted by the musician himself.  She also became a frequent guest on another popular television show, Nghệ Sĩ Với Chiến Sĩ, produced by Nguyen Dinh Toan.  \n\nIn 1974, Son Ca recorded her first studio album which was self-titled and produced by Nguyen Van Dong for the Continental record label in South Vietnam.  Among her most well-received songs from the debut album included Mùa Thu Cho Em written by Ngo Thuy Mien, Bây Giờ Tháng Mấy? written by Tu Cong Phung and all three versions of Hòn Vọng Phu written by Le Thuong.  Son Ca also recorded for other major record labels in South Vietnam including Viet Nam and Shotguns.  Her name became linked with a string of hit songs Hoang Thi Tho had written especially for her to record such as Đám Cưới Trên Đường Quê, Rước Tình Về Với Quê Hương, Tình Ca Trên Lúa and Gạo Trắng Trăng Thanh.  Among her other popular songs included Gánh Lúa written by Pham Duy, Duyên Nước Tình Trăng written by Hoang Nguyen, Tàu Về Quê Hương written by Hong Van and what would become known as her signature song, Cô Thắm Về Làng written by Giao Tien which she had recorded for the Shotguns label as a duet with singer Thai Chau.  Right around this time, Son Ca teamed up with her former classmate and close friend, Bui Thien, to become one of the most popular singing duos in South Vietnam.  Their most popular hit song recorded together was Đưa Em Qua Cánh Đồng Vàng written by Hoang Thi Tho.  \n\nAfter the Fall of Saigon in 1975, Son Ca continued her career as a singer collaborating with theater troupes headed by Kim Cuong and by Tham Thuy Hang.  In 1976, she married and started a family with the birth of a daughter the following year.  In the summer of 1979, she along with her husband, young daughter and a younger sister fled from communist Vietnam by boat landing at a refugee camp in Thailand where they remained for six months before resettling in the United States on January of 1980.\n\nDuring their first year in the United States, Son Ca and her family lived in San Jose, California.  In 1981, she along with her husband and their 4-year-old daughter relocated to Houston, Texas for work as they helped run and operate a gas station/convenience store owned by a family friend.  After three years living in Houston, Son Ca decided to resume her singing career and packed up for Orange County, Calfornia, home of the largest concentrated Vietnamese-American population.  With the money she had saved up during the previous years working in Houston, Son Ca took a gamble and produced a studio album in 1984 entitled as Tiếng Hát Sơn Ca Hải Ngoại and distributed by Thanh Lan music production label.  The gamble would pay off as her first album produced overseas would generate a sizable profit for Son Ca as it sold quite well within overseas Vietnamese communities across the United States and abroad.  From 1984 until 1990, Son Ca produced over a dozen studio albums which also featured recordings by various overseas Vietnamese singers such as Bui Thien, Khanh Ly, Thanh Tuyen, Phuong Dung, Giao Linh, Huong Lan, Lilian and Phuong Hoai Tam.

Eleven years later, she would be invited back on the Paris By Night stage for volumes 41 and 47, both of which were filmed in Toronto, Canada paying tribute to the music of Hoang Thi Tho.  Son Ca\'s last Paris By Night performance to date was in a duet with Thai Chau, Bài Ngợi Ca Quê Hương for volume 83 released in 2006.  For Asia Entertainment, Son Ca has appeared on volumes 65-68 which were filmed from 2010 until 2011 with performances of songs such as Rước Tình Về Với Quê Hương in a duet with singer Ngoc Huyen, Việt Nam Ơi!

Temas como Una ventana al mundo, seleccionado como tema principal del disco, en el que, sobre una base de carácter mas funky, Payo nos brinda una visión personal de los rudos contrastes sociales existentes entre clases. Despierto y pierdo, musicalmente más cercana al rock contemporáneo que al rap actual, nos muestra, en clave mas realista, las ilusiones de las que surgen nuestras decepciones a diario. Mi cartera es mi Biblia, una melodía ácida, para una rima brutalmente clara, sincera y descarnada en la que más de uno se verá reflejado. Para este trabajo, Shico Shanante utiliza pinceladas de estilos tan influyentes en la génesis del rap como el jazz, el funk, el soul o el r&b que, puestos a disposición de la lírica de PAYO MALO, tiene como resultado un disco que abrirá mentes de dentro y fuera de la comunidad del rap.

Released in 1996, it featured production by Missy Elliott and Diddy, and featured appearances by Elliott, Diddy, and Craig Mack, among others. Her first single from the album, \"The Things That You Do\", was a success, peaking at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, and number 12 on Billboard\'s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. The album itself peaked at number 36 on The Billboard 200 album chart, and was certified Platinum by the RIAA in 1998. Her song, \"You Bring the Sunshine\", was produced by Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds and was included on the NBA @ 50 compilation album as the lead single. It peaked at number 53 on the Hot 100.\n\nAlso in 1996 Thompson performed background vocals for the song \"Cold Rock A Party\" by MC Lyte featuring Missy Elliott and Puff Daddy. She also appeared on Lyte\'s 1997 album Seven & Seven, on the track \'It\'s All Yours\". Later work included \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\", a re-imagining of the 1955 Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers hit of the same name. Thompson\'s \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\" featuring Missy Elliott and rapper Mocha, was featured in the 1998 Lymon biopic Why Do Fools Fall in Love and its soundtrack. The singer also appeared on Missy Elliott\'s second album, Da Real World.\n\nThompson\'s second album, If You Only Knew, was set to be released in September 21, 1999 on Elektra Records through Missy Elliott\'s The Goldmind Inc. imprint. Two singles were released in advance of the album\'s anticipated release date: \"Ya Di Ya\", featuring Elliott, peaked at number 38 on the R&B chart, while \"Caught Up\", featuring rapper Beanie Sigel, failed to chart. The album was shelved, and Thompson asked to be released from her contract. Thompson continued to perform as an independent artist, and began work on a third album in 2008.\n\nOn July 28, 2008, Gina Thompson released a song \"We Don\'t Talk No More (Dancehall Remix)\" which failed to chart due to lack of promotion. The song was released through Blue Mountain Records, and served as the lead single for her official second studio album.\n\nOn February 23, 2009, Gina Thompson released her second studio album, Missing You. The album was released as a digital download on online markets, while physical copies of the alum were released through Amazon. The album suffered the same fate as its lead single, where it failed to chart. While the album\'s title track, \"Missing You\", was set to be released as the second single, all future singles were canceled, and Gina Thompson was ultimately dropped from Blue Mountain Records.',15866,80362),(525,'Ike Reilly','Ike Reilly (born Michael Christopher Reilly on 27 December 1963 in Naval Station, Great Lakes) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, and writer as well as frontman and founder of the rock band The Ike Reilly Assassination.\n\nIf you\'re looking for glossy pop, this ain\'t it. Ike and his Assassination reel off \"real-rock\", tune after tune. Lyrically rough and sharp, but poignant and intellectual. If you like fun, witty, and sometimes coarse (yet still smart) harder alt. rock, then this is your ticket to paradise. Crack open a beer with some friends and enjoy Ike \'til the last drop.',9400,150691),(526,'James Last','James Last (Hans Last, * April 17, 1929 in Bremen, † June, 9, 2015 in Florida) was a German composer and big band leader with a large fan base in Europe and world-wide. Last\'s trademark was arranging pop hits in a big-band style; his series of \"party albums\" is equally well-known. Over the course of his career, he has sold well over 100 million albums.\n\nLast learned how to play piano as child, switching to bass as a teenager. He joined Hans-Gunther Oesterreich\'s Radio Bremen Dance Orchestra in 1946, when he was 17 years old. In 1948, he became the leader of the Becker-Last Ensemble, which performed for seven years. During that time, he was voted as the best bassist in the country by a German jazz poll for three consecutive years, from 1950-1952. After the disbandment of the Becker-Last Ensemble, he became the in-house arranger for Polydor Records, as well as for a number of European radio stations. For the next decade, he helped arrange hits for artists like Helmut Zacharias and Caterina Valente.\n\nLast released his first album \"Non-Stop Dancing\" in 1965. The record of brief renditions of popular songs, all tied together by an insistent dance beat and joyous crowd noises. It was a hit and helped make him a major European star. Over the next four decades, Last has released over 190 records, including several more volumes of Non-Stop Dancing. On these records, he varies his formula by adding different songs from different countries and genres, as well as guest performers like Richard Clayderman and Astrud Gilberto.\n\nThough his concerts and albums are consistently successful — especially in England, where he had 52 hit albums between 1967-1986, which made him second to Elvis Presley in terms of number of charting records — he has only had two hit singles with \"The Seduction,\" the theme from American Gigolo (1980) and Biscaya from the album \"Biscaya\".\n\nHe has won numerous polls and prizes, for example Billboard magazine\'s \"Star of the year\" trophy in 1976, and has been honored for his lifework with the German ECHO prize in 1994.\n\nThe song \"The Lonely Shepherd\", written by Last and performed by Gheorghe Zamfir and the James Last Orchestra, was featured in the soundtrack to Quentin Tarantino\'s film \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" (2003). \n\nPersonally, he divides his time between Florida and Germany. He gives much credit to his wife and son, who helps with the music.',205179,2314998),(527,'Vanilla Ice','Robert Matthew Van Winkle (born October 31, 1967), best known by his stage name Vanilla Ice is an American rapper. Born in Dallas, Texas, United States, and raised in Texas and South Florida, Van Winkle started his musical career in 1988 and released his debut album, \'Hooked\', in 1989 through Ichiban Records. He soon signed a contract with SBK Records, which released a reformatted version of that album under the title \'To the Extreme\'. Van Winkle\'s single \"Ice Ice Baby\" was the first hip-hop single to top the Billboard charts, and it has been credited with helping to diversify hip-hop by introducing it to a mainstream white audience.\n\nAlthough Van Winkle was successful, he later regretted his business arrangements with SBK, which had paid him to adopt a more commercial appearance and had published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. He strongly resented having to \'play along\' with claims that he had survived violent underground gang fights while also wearing glamorized outfits. After surviving a suicide attempt by drug overdose when his mainstream fame evaporated, Van Winkle was inspired to change his musical style and lifestyle. Further albums by Van Winkle, including \'Hard to Swallow\', \'Bi-Polar\', and \'Platinum Underground\', featured a less mainstream-oriented sound inspired by alternative metal. His latest album is \'Wisdom, Tenacity & Focus\' (better known as just \'WTF\'), which he released in 2011, which feature Ice\'s return to the more electronic and classic hip-hop sound that was present in some of his past classics.\n\nAs stated before, Van Winkle signed a contract with SBK Records in 1990, who reissued \'Hooked\' under the title \'To the Extreme\'. The reissue contained new artwork and music. According to Van Winkle, SBK paid him to adopt a more commercial, conventional appearance. Getting a break touring with MC Hammer, Van Winkle largely copied that artist\'s large stage shows, oversize pants, flamboyant hairstyles, and more. Van Winkle is quoted as saying that: {\"They told me, we want you to wear these baggy pants because the young kids like it and it\'s all glittery and polished and everything, and I said, \'Fuck no, I\'m not wearin\' this gay-ass shit.\' And they said, \'Well here\'s a million dollars, man, will you do it?\' And I said, \'Fuck yes.\' And anybody would have done the same thing if they were given the same chance.\"}\n\nThe distribution of fabricated biographical information (such as that he was from Miami rather than Texas and that he had a long gang history) also helped quickly erode his street credibility. Though confident in his rhyming abilities and flow, Van Winkle soon regretted his business agreements with SBK and even expressed reservations when his fame grew. \'To the Extreme\' became the fastest selling hip hop album of all time, peaking at #1 on the Billboard 200. The album spent 16 weeks on the charts, and it sold eleven million copies before long. For many years, it remained the best selling hip hop album of all time.\n\nSingle \"Ice Ice Baby\" has been credited for helping diversify rap music by introducing it to a mainstream, white audience. Still, critical reviews of \'To the Extreme\' have been mixed. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Mim Udovitch gave the album a B, citing \"Ice Ice Baby\", \"Play That Funky Music\", \"Dancin\'\" and \"It\'s a Party\" as the album\'s highlights. Robert Christgau gave the album a C− rating, writing that Van Winkle\'s \"suave sexism, fashionably male supremacist rather than dangerously obscene, is no worse than his suave beats\". \n\nCriticizing the technique and style shown, Allmusic reviewer Steve Huey wrote: {\"Ice\'s mic technique is actually stronger and more nimble than MC Hammer\'s, and he really tries earnestly to show off the skills he does have. Unfortunately, even if he can keep a mid-tempo pace, his flow is rhythmically stiff, and his voice has an odd timbre; plus, he never seems sure of the proper accent to adopt. He\'s able to overcome those flaws somewhat in isolated moments, but they become all too apparent over the course of an entire album.\"}\n\nFollowing the success of \"Ice Ice Baby\", California rapper Mario \"Chocolate\" Johnson, an associate of record producer Suge Knight, claimed that he had written and produced the song but had not received credit or royalties for the song. Van Winkle has often recounted the following story. Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, where Van Winkle was eating. After shoving Van Winkle\'s bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards sat down in front of Van Winkle, staring at him before finally asking \"How you doin\'?\" Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions. Eventually, Knight showed up at Van Winkle\'s hotel suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by Johnson and a member of the Oakland Raiders. According to Van Winkle, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied that he would throw him off the balcony unless he signed the rights to the song over to Knight.\n\nVan Winkle has changed his accounting of said story over the years, which is still controversial years on. At any rate, by late 1990, Van Winkle began an eight-month relationship with Madonna, and appeared in photographs for her book \'Sex\' while living a lavish lifestyle as a commercial superstar. While on tour in 1991, Van Winkle found out that SBK had instigated the publication of a book, \'Ice by Ice: The Vanilla Ice Story in His Own Words\', written by Quon and attributed to Van Winkle, which detailed false biographical information, including claims that he had attended school with Luther Campbell. According to Van Winkle: {\"I was paid to have this label on it, \'authorized,\' because there was like 6 or 7 books out before that says unauthorized right on the cover, meaning that it\'s bullshit right away. And so they paid me, I believe it was like $850,000 just to have that label and they printed the book. And it\'s full of shit. I read the book myself and I\'m like, \'God, how could you fucking do that to me?\'\"}\n\nAfter hiring investigators to find out who was involved in the book\'s publication, he found out that Quon and promoter Elaine Shock had been involved in publishing and promoting the fabricated biographical elements. Although he later greatly rejects being subject to such commercial exposure, Van Winkle found himself caught up in his \'sex, drugs, and rock n roll\' lifestyle at the time. Buying motorcycles, mansions, and more, it was all a great change from his working-class upbringing.\n\nVan Winkle\'s second major release was the live album \'Extremely Live\', released in March 1991. It peaked at #30 on the Billboard 200. Reviews of the album were particularly negative, with Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne calling it \"one of the most ridiculous albums ever released\" (comparing it to \'The Best of Marcel Marceau\', an album which consisted of two sides of silence opened by brief applause\'). According to Browne, \'Extremely Live\' \"affords you the chance to hear inane stage patter and unaccompanied drumming, during which, one assumes, Ice and his posse are onstage dancing.\"\n\nVan Winkle branched out into the film industry, making an appearance in the film \'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze\' and performing the tune \"Ninja Rap\". Beginning to film his own personal project, \'Cool as Ice\', in April 1991, he found himself soon embroiled in more controversy. On June 3, 1991, Van Winkle was arrested in Los Angeles on firearm charges, after threatening a homeless man, James N. Gregory, with a pistol. Gregory had approached Van Winkle\'s car outside of a supermarket and attempted to sell him a silver chain. Van Winkle and his bodyguard were charged with three weapons offenses. Van Winkle pleaded no contest.\n\n\'Cool as Ice\' opened on October 18, 1991 in 393 theaters in the United States, grossing $638,000, ranking at #14 among the week\'s new releases. However, it soon became a \'box office bomb\' that severely weakened his career. Reviews of the film were widely negative. Film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 8%, and Van Winkle received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star.\n\nDuring this period, Van Winkle received criticism from other hip hop musicians. In 1991, 3rd Bass released a single called \"Pop Goes the Weasel\", comparing Van Winkle unfavorably to Elvis Presley. The song\'s music video featured Henry Rollins as Van Winkle, who is depicted as being assaulted by 3rd Bass. Del tha Funkee Homosapien referred to Van Winkle as mocking hip hop in the lyrics of \"Pissin\' on Your Steps\", which appeared on his 1991 debut album (titled \'I Wish My Brother George Was Here\').\n\nBy 1994, Van Winkle became isolated from the public spotlight, and had grown dreadlocks and began smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Van Winkle released his second studio album, Mind Blowin. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album \"more clunky than funky\". Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song \"Get Loose\" as \"snappy\", writing that although the lyrics are \"inane\", \"the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of \'The Wrath\' as well In \'Now and Forever,\' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics.\" Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \"There isn\'t a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing.\" Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Van Winkle\'s cannabis-oriented lyrics: \"That\'s all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people.\"\n\nVan Winkle began using ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. During periods of heavy drug use, Van Winkle received many tattoos from artist acquaintances. According to Van Winkle, \"That was in my binge days. I didn\'t even realize how many I was getting\". Van Winkle attempted suicide with a heroin overdose. After being revived, Van Winkle decided that it was time to change his lifestyle. As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach.\n\nIn 1995, Van Winkle set up a recording studio in Miami, and joined a grunge band, Picking Scabs. Van Winkle expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound which he was looking for. In 1997, Van Winkle married Laura, whom he had met at a party. Van Winkle later developed a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, who had become known for producing music by Deftones, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sepultura. Robinson and Van Winkle shared an interest in motocross racing. According to Robinson, others had attempted to persuade him not to work with Van Winkle, feeling that it might hurt his reputation. Encouraged by this fear, Robinson agreed to work with Van Winkle. In an interview, Robinson stated \"It\'s the most punk-rock thing you could do.\"\n\nVan Winkle\'s third studio album, Hard to Swallow, featured a darker sound and lyrics than Van Winkle\'s previous work. Reviews of the album were generally negative. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that \"If history is any guide, Vanilla Ice\'s adoption of rap-metal means that hard rock is about to move on.\" Richard Torres of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, writing that while \"nothing, however, can redeem Ice\'s wack boasting,\" the album \"isn\'t half-bad.\" In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Kemp gave the album three out of five stars, writing that it contained Van Winkle\'s \"most convincing music\". In 1999, the music video for \"Ice Ice Baby\" was \"retired\" on the MTV special 25 Lame, in which Van Winkle himself appeared to destroy the video\'s master tape. When Van Winkle was given a baseball bat, he ended up destroying the show\'s set.\nIndependent releases (2000 onward)\nVanilla Ice appearing at the Tex-Mex Grill in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nHaving attracted a following outside of his former mainstream audience, Van Winkle began recording independently. In May 2000, Van Winkle made an appearance at a wrestling match promoted by Juggalo Championship Wrestling, then known as Juggalo Championshit Wrestling, filling in for Insane Clown Posse member Joseph Utsler, who had been injured during a match. It was reported that Insane Clown Posse would make an appearance on Van Winkle\'s next album, tentatively titled Bomb Tha System. In October 2000, it was announced that Van Winkle\'s next album would be titled Skabz, and that Chuck D was confirmed to appear on the album. It was initially planned as a double album featuring a disc containing rock-oriented material and a disc of hip hop songs.\n\nIn January 2001, Van Winkle was arrested by police in Davie, Florida for assaulting Laura. According to the criminal complaint, Van Winkle and his wife argued as they drove on Interstate 595. Van Winkle admitted to pulling hair from her head to prevent her from jumping out of the truck\'s window. He pleaded guilty to charges of disorderly conduct four months later, and was sentenced to probation and ordered to attend family therapy sessions. In July 2001, Van Winkle performed at the second Gathering of the Juggalos. On October 23, 2001, Skabz and Bomb Tha System were released as a single album, Bi-Polar. Bradley Torreano of Allmusic disliked the album, criticizing it as \"wildly uneven and at times hilariously bad\". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Kemp gave the album one out of five stars, calling the album \"utterly listless\".\n\nFrom January to February 2004, Van Winkle appeared on the reality television series The Surreal Life. In November 2004, Van Winkle\'s pet wallaroo, Bucky, and pet goat, Pancho, escaped from his Port St. Lucie, Florida home. After wandering around local streets for over a week, the animals were caught and returned to Van Winkle. He had to pay a $220 fine for expired pet tags and an undisclosed fine for the escape of the animals. On August 2, 2005, Van Winkle released his fifth studio album, Platinum Underground. Van Winkle stated that the title of the album reflected the fact that he could maintain a fanbase without mainstream airplay. Allmusic reviewer Rob Theakston panned the album, writing that it \"has more bad spots in it than most\".\n\nOn April 10, 2008, Van Winkle was arrested in Palm Beach County on a battery charge for allegedly kicking and hitting Laura. He was released the following day after she declared that her husband had only pushed her. In court, the couple\'s neighbor, Frank Morales, stated that it was merely a verbal argument. Van Winkle was ordered by a Florida court to stay away from his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him. The judge told Van Winkle that he could only contact his wife via telephone. On April 29, 2008, Van Winkle\'s lawyers, Bradford Cohen and Joseph LoRusso, were able to get the case dropped after providing the state attorney with evidence that conflicted with what was originally reported.\n\nVan Winkle began following a vegetarian diet. In September 2008, Van Winkle signed a contract with Cleopatra Records, recording the cover album Vanilla Ice Is Back! at the label\'s request. The album was released on November 4, 2008, and contained covers of songs by Public Enemy, House of Pain, Bob Marley and Cypress Hill. IGN reviewer Spence D. called the album \"an embarrassing endeavor that sounds like it should have stayed locked inside Ice\'s studio (or at the very least leaked on YouTube and passed off as a piss take).\" On February 27, 2009, Van Winkle performed as part of a joint performance with MC Hammer in Orem, Utah. In March 2009, Van Winkle participated in a Virgin Mobile advertising campaign titled \"Right Music Wrongs\", apologizing for his 1990s image. As part of the campaign, Van Winkle was placed on \"trial\", and was voted innocent by users of the campaign website. In August 2009, Van Winkle announced on his official Twitter account that he had signed a contract with StandBy Records, who will release his sixth studio album, Yesterday Is History, Tomorrow Is A Mystery.\n Style and influences\nVan Winkle performing in Massachusetts on February 16, 2007\n\nVan Winkle\'s current live performances feature a mix of newer, rock-influenced material and old school hip hop. Van Winkle performs with a live drummer and DJ, and sometimes sprays his audience with bottled water. Describing his performances, Van Winkle stated \"It\'s high energy, stage diving, pyrotechnics, girls showing their breasts. It\'s crazy party atmosphere.\" In promotion of Hard to Swallow, Van Winkle toured with a seven-piece live band which included bassist Scott Shriner. The band opened with rock-oriented material from Hard to Swallow and concluded with older hip hop songs.\n\nVan Winkle stated that his musical style was influenced by underground music, rather than mainstream music, and that his influences included hip hop and funk artists such as Funkadelic, Rick James and Parliament. Van Winkle also stated that he enjoys Rage Against the Machine, Slipknot and System of a Down. Van Winkle sometimes plays bass, drums and keyboards on studio recordings. Rapper G-Child, best known for her appearance on ego trip\'s The (White) Rapper Show, has credited Van Winkle as being a major influence on her work. After meeting Van Winkle in 2000, G-Child performed freestyle raps at six of Van Winkle\'s performances, and opened for him four times.\n\n\nBand members\n\nCurrent\n\n    * DJ Dirty Chopstix — turntables and background vocals\n    * Keith Reber — drums\n    * DJ DP - turntables and background vocals\n\nFormer\n\n    * D-Shay — disc jockey\n    * Clint Barlow - drums\n    * Earthquake — disc jockey\n    * Rod J — disc jockey\n    * Zero — disc jockey\n    * Scott Shriner — bass\n\nDiscography\nMain article: Vanilla Ice discography\n\n    * To the Extreme (1990)\n    * Extremely Live (1991)\n    * Mind Blowin (1994)\n    * Hard to Swallow (1998)\n    * Bi-Polar (2001)\n    * Platinum Underground (2005)\n    * Yesterday Is History, Tomorrow Is A Mystery (2009)\n* WTF (2011)',885659,4398989),(528,'Dee Nasty','Daniel \"Dee Nasty\" Efferne began his DJ\'ing career back in 1981 after discovering Hip-Hop back in 1979.

G&G Sindikatas consists of 5 members - 3 MCs: Svaras, Kastetas, Pushaz, producer Donciavas and a DJ - DJ Mamania. \n\nG&G Sindikatas have been a part of the Lithuanian hip-hop scene for 11 years already. In the very beginning, the band consisted of 2 MC\'s (Svaras & Giga) laying rhymes down on the music produced by Exem, the well-known Lithuanian electronic music project. The band gave occasional live and radio performances. A collaboration track with the punk band \"Turboreanimacija\" even managed to reach No. 1 in the charts of a then-popular independent radio station.\n\nIn 1997, the high tide of hip-hop was gone in Lithuania. MC Giga left the band to pursue a career in a different field, while Svaras continued working on new tracks. In 1998, he met producer Donciavas who was working in a small independent recording studio called Porno Sound and eventually started producing new instrumentals for Svaras. Kastetas, a former punk rock drummer who was working on his hip-hop project Afro in the same studio, later appeared on several tracks by Svaras. Guest appearances were also made by MC Pushaz, then member of the well-known hip-hop band Zenitas.\n\nSvaras was in search of a DJ to provide scratching tricks during live performances. Soon he got to know DJ Mamania, who from that point on became permanently associated with the group. It wasn’t long before the first official full-length by G&G Sindikatas was ready for release. Titled “Tavo sielos vagiz” (Your Soul’s Thief), it was released by the independent label Guru Records and appeared in the stores right before Christmas 1999.

In June 2001, \"Gatves lyga\" (The Street League), the group’s second album, was released. It took a mere month before it went gold, selling 10 000 copies. At that point, MC Pushaz joined the forces and started performing together with G&G. In one year, G&G Sindikatas became a five-piece band.\n\nIn the same year, G&G won the Best Debut nominations in two Lithuanian music awards (Radiocentras and Bravo). Right after that came their third album, \"Betono Sakmės\" (Stories of Concrete), taking less than a month to go gold. In October 2002, G&G started its first Lithuanian tour, giving 20 concerts in various cities and towns.\n\n2002 was the year when G&G Sindikatas started participating in more diverse and genre-crossing collaborations. Famous Lithuanian composer Linas Rimša invited G&G to take part in two of his projects: Opera in da House and Guerilla Jazz.lt, in which famous Lithuanian jazz musicians took part as well. The imaginative fusion of jazz and hip-hop led the Guerilla Jazz.lt project to be included in the line-up of the international jazz festival Kaunas Jazz 2003. \n\nG&G Sindikatas’ long-time dream came true in 2003 as well: the band finally performed abroad. Concerts in Riga (Latvia), Tallin (Estonia), and Wroclaw (Poland) provided new impressions and experience.\n\nAt the moment, G&G Sindikatas are working on a new album. A DVD featuring best live performances of G&G is released, while Mamania and Svaras, joined by DJ Mantini, continue producing their regular Gatvės Lyga radio shows that were recently brought back to life.',19954,897799),(532,'Mad Skillz','Skillz (formerly Mad Skillz, born Donnie Shaquan Lewis in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rapper. Known as a talented freestyle rapper, Skillz has not received widespread acclaim outside of the hip-hop community, but within it is considered one of its best performers.\n\nHe first made a name for himself by finishing in second place in a national freestyle competition in 1992, which resulted in a recording contract with Atlantic Records. Skillz\' Atlantic debut, From Where???, and its single, \"The Nod Factor\", were released in 1996, but sank without a trace. In the late-1990s, he allied himself with fellow Virginia natives Missy Elliott, Timbaland, and The Neptunes. He made appearances on Timbaland\'s albums Tim\'s Bio in 1998, and Indecent Proposal in 2001; Timbaland made plans to sign Skillz to the Blackhand label he was developing, the label failed to materialize. He along with Danja Mowf, Lonnie B, and Patrice O\'Neal, members of Mad Skillz\' Supafriendz collective, also appeared on a remix of Aaliyah\'s hit single \"Are You That Somebody\" in 1998.\n\nMore recently (2000) Skillz is known for his tell all single \"Ghostwriter\".

Diddy, Foxy Brown, Mase, and Jermaine Dupri. One artist who openly admits Skillz has written hits for him is P. Diddy.\nFrom 2002 through 2006 Skillz has done a year end \"Rap-Up\" song that encapsulates the events of the prior 12 months.\n\nSkillz eventually got a deal with Rawkus, where he recorded his 2002 LP I Ain\'t Mad No More, the title of which commemorated the official change of his MC moniker from \"Mad Skillz\" to just \"Skillz\". The afore mentioned LP was never officially released in the U.S., however, during the Sprite Liquid Mix Tour in 2003 he sold some bootleg versions of this CD. The CD was re-packaged without several tracks as \"Confessions Of A Ghostwriter\" in 2005. A Supafriends LP, Supavision, and another solo LP.

The duo\'s album, Totally Krossed Out, was released in 1992 and sold more than four million copies. It included the hit single \"Jump\", which stayed at number one on the Billboard charts for eight weeks. This landed them a spot on Michael Jackson\'s European tour that year as well as a cameo appearance in Michael Jackson\'s \"Jam\" video.\n\nIt became a short-lived fad for youth to wear their pants backwards.\n\n1992, at the peak of their popularity, a video game was released starring the pair entitled Kris Kross: Make My Video. It was released on the Sega CD system, and consisted of the player editing together the groups music videos to a few of their hit songs using portions of the original music videos, stock footage, and general video animation effects. Players were prompted before each edit session to make sure to have certain footage compiled into the video. The game was released in the US only to very lackluster sales figures and dismal reviews. It was ranked 18th on Electronic Gaming Monthly\'s list of the 20 Worst Games of All Time.\n\nIn 1993, Kris Kross released their second album entitled Da Bomb, which went platinum. 1996 saw the release of their final album Young, Rich & Dangerous which went gold.

Others are serving consecutive life sentences for homicide.\n\nIn making it through, the 35-year-old learned several important lessons that impacted his rap career.\n“ 	That’s what I fuel my music on,” he says. “I’m speaking about the past, and I can still understand what the young cats are doing now because I’ve been through it.

The two quickly became friends, particularly when Scoob learned that Tech lived in his same neighborhood.\n\nThe two lost touch soon after graduating from Southwest High in 1991. Tech moved on to work on his rap career, while Scoob was still running the streets.\n\nIn the mid ‘90s after Scoob had cleaned up his act and began pursuing music, their paths crossed again. This time they met up at a music expo in Minnesota. Scoob was looking at starting his own group, while Tech was in between labels.

Widely regarded as one of the most underrated emcees in hip-hop, AZ first rose to prominence with his iconic verse on “Life’s a Bitch,” from Nas’s groundbreaking 1994 album Illmatic. His smooth delivery and vivid imagery instantly made him a standout voice in the genre.\n\nIn 1995, AZ released his debut album Doe or Die, which received critical acclaim and achieved commercial success, peaking at No. 15 on the Billboard 200. The album’s lead single, “Sugar Hill,” became AZ’s most successful song, reaching No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning Gold certification. Known for its themes of luxury and escape from hardship, the track solidified AZ as a respected solo artist.\n\nAZ’s career further expanded as a member of the supergroup The Firm, which included Nas, Foxy Brown, and Nature, with Dr. Dre and The Trackmasters handling production. The group’s 1997 album, The Album, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 but received mixed reviews. Despite this, AZ continued to thrive, releasing acclaimed solo projects such as Pieces of a Man (1998) and Aziatic (2002). The latter featured the single “The Essence,” a duet with Nas that earned a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.\n\nOver the years, AZ released a series of well-received albums, including A.W.O.L. (2005) and The Format (2006), while maintaining his reputation as one of the genre’s most skilled lyricists.

He is currently wrapping up his second album, Louisville Slugger.\n\n2004-2005: Musical Beginnings\n\nJ-Kwon first got signed in a very odd and amusing way. He would continually mock who would be his main producer, Jermaine Dupri, who produced a majority of his first album, Hood Hop. Regardless, according to Dupri, J-Kwon was also signed because of his rapping skills.\n\nJ-Kwon first rose to stardom with his single \"Tipsy\" and his 2004 album Hood hop. J-Kwon\'s debut peaked at #7 on the Billboard 200. It has reached gold status, selling approximentaly 650,000 copies to date. \"Tipsy\" peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at #4 in the UK, becoming a success and making it his biggest single to date. A music video was filmed for the single, which was an obvious remake of Gin & Juice by Snoop Dogg. Strangely on the set of this music video, a shot was fired from a passing vehicle. The shot hit a window of a van, but no one was hurt.\n\nAfter \"Tipsy\" has done its fair share on the radio, Jive parted with \"You & Me\", featuring Sadiyyah, as the second single. J-Kwon wanted \"Parking Lot\" or \"Hood Hop\" to be a second single, but Jive decided \"You & Me\" with the fall and holiday theme in mind. While nowhere near as successful as the earlier smash, the song did chart to #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and landed a spot on the 17th edition of Now That\'s What I Call Music! Afterwards, third single \"Hood Hop\" had little success, not charting on The Hot 100 and only getting to #52 on Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Tracks.\n\nJ-Kwon rose back to stardom in 2005 when he was given the opportunity to make the priority song on the XXX: State of the Union soundtrack. The song, \"Get XXX\'d\", featuring Petey Pablo and Ebony Eyez, was completed soon enough and was featured on the normal soundtrack and in the credits. Also in 2005, he promoted another part of media, this time in television, when he collabrated with comedian Andy Milonakis in \"Like Dis\", to promote The Andy Milonakis Show.\n\nHis record company, Gracie Entertainment, announced in March 2010 that he had been missing for a month.

He released his debut album Incognegro in 1999 and has since released a further seven albums. His ninth studio album, Ludaversal, will be released sometime in 2012.\n\nEarly years\n\nBridges began his music career as a radio personality and DJ as Chris Lova Lova on Hot 97, an urban radio station in Atlanta, Georgia. He made his recorded debut on \"Phat Rabbit,\" a track from Timbaland\'s 1998 album Tim\'s Bio: Life from the Basement. Although both Timbaland and Jermaine Dupri showed interest in signing Ludacris, he decided to release the album \"Incognegro\" independently in 1999. The album sold over 50,000 copies through the Atlanta based independent music distributor, Southern Music Distribution. The same year, he recorded the theme to the video game Madden NFL 2000. Scarface, an original member of the Geto Boys, signed Ludacris in 2000 to Def Jam Recordings, and created a new imprint, Def Jam South, around him.\n\nBack for the First Time\n\nLudacris released his major label debut, Back for the First Time, in October 2000. The album reached as high as #4 on the charts, and was a major success. Ludacris made his mark on the industry with singles such as \"Southern Hospitality\" and \"What\'s Your Fantasy\", along with his first ever single \"Phat Rabbit\", from 2 years prior. Back for the First Time was the beginning of Ludacris\'s explosion to the top of the rap world.\n\nWord of Mouf\n\nLudacris promptly completed his next album, Word Of Mouf and released it at the end of 2001. Its lead single, \"Rollout (My Business)\" was boycotted in many American video stations. Despite the controversy, the video was nominated for a 2003 VMA, and Luda performed it live at the awards\' pre-show. Ludacris also toured with Papa Roach in 2002 after the release of their sophomore album lovehatetragedy. Ludacris reached a new level of notoriety when TV\'s Bill O\'Reilly expressed outrage that Pepsi had hired Ludacris as a spokesman. O\'Reilly repeatedly attacked Ludacris\'s foul language and called for a nation-wide boycott of Pepsi, who then fired Ludacris and hired Ozzy Osbourne\'s family instead.\n\nChicken-N-Beer\n\nDuring the spring of 2003, Ludacris returned to the music scene after a brief hiatus with a new single, \"Act A Fool\" from the 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack. At around the same time, he released the lead single from his upcoming album, Chicken & Beer, called \"P-Poppin\" (short for \"Pussy Poppin\'\"). Neither of his new singles were as well-received by either the urban or pop audiences as his previous songs had been, and both music videos received only limited airplay. Chicken & Beer opened strongly, but without a popular single, the album fell quickly.\n\nHowever, in the fall of 2003, Ludacris rebounded with his next single, \"Stand Up\", which appeared on both Chicken & Beer as well as the soundtrack for the teen hip-hop/dance movie, Honey. Produced by Kanye West, \"Stand Up\" went on to become Ludacris\' biggest mainstream hit to date, hitting the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and garnering heavy airplay on mainstream pop, rhythmic, and urban radio stations, as well as on MTV, MTV2, and BET.\n\nThe album\'s next single, \"Splash Waterfalls\", was released in early 2004. Though not a pop hit, it became a success at urban radio and BET. It was Ludacris\' most sexual video yet and an R&B remix that featured Raphael Saadiq and sampled Tony! Toni! Tone!\'s \"Whatever You Want\". Luda next released \"Blow It Out\", a gritty song that had a heavily low-budget, gritty, and urban-looking music video, which was a huge departure from the colorful, sensual, R&B leanings depicted in \"Splash Waterfalls\". \"Blow It Out\" acted both as a scathing response to the aforementioned criticism levied by Bill O\'Reilly and an expression of disgust at Pepsi\'s cowardice in the affair:\n\n    Shout out to Bill O\'Reilly, I\'m\'a throw you a curve\n    You mad cause I\'m a thief and got away with words\n    I\'m\'a start my own beverage, it\'ll calm your nerves\n    Pepsi\'s the New Generation?—Blow it out cha ass!\n\n    * On 1 June 2006, a federal jury found that \"Stand Up\" did not infringe on the copyright of a song called \"Straight Like That\" by a New Jersey group known as I.O.F. \"I hope the plaintiffs enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame,\" Ludacris said after the verdict. \"This whole experience is proof to me of why I will always fight for what I believe in.\"\n\nThe Red Light District\n\nThe fourth studio album from Ludacris. Although entirely different from the usual antics of the previous albums, Ludacris had taken a more mature approach to his album. Ludacris openly boasted that he may be the only rapper able to keep the Def Jam label afloat. Ludacris had recently filmed and recorded the single \"Get Back\" in which he was featured a muscle-bounded hulk who was being annoyed by the media and warned his critics to leave him alone. He also was featured on Saturday Night Live playing his song Get Back with Sum 41. The follow-up single was the Austin Powers-inspired \"The Number One Spot\". It was produced by New York City\'s Hot 97 personality DJ Green Lantern. It used the Quincy Jones sample of \"Soul Bossa Nova\" and sped it up to the tempo of Ludacris\' rap flow. Ludacris also filmed the video in which he pokes fun at O\'Reilly\'s problems with Andrea Mackris (Hi Mr. O\'Reilly / Hope all is well kiss the plaintiff and the wifey). Production credits come also from veteran producers Timbaland, Lil\' Jon, The Medicine Men and legendary rapper Doug E. Fresh. Featured artists on the album include Nas, DJ Quik, DMX, Trick Daddy, and Disturbing Tha Peace newcomers Bobby Valentino (of Mista fame) and Dolla Boi and Small World. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts. And most recently the rapper had used his opportunity to start his own foundation. The Ludacris Foundation started by Ludacris and Chaka Zulu is an organization that helps young middle and high school students motivate themselves in creative arts. Ludacris also has a daughter by the name of Karma. Ludacris had also participated at the Super Bowl and is the spokesman for the Boost Mobile Phone ad-campaign. Ludacris also received his first Grammy Award with Usher and Lil Jon for their hit single \"Yeah\"\n\nRelease Therapy\n\nIn a recent issue of XXL, a hip-hop based magazine, Ludacris was placed in the number nine spot for the most anticipated albums of 2006, for Release Therapy.

Ludacris is the second and only rapper to host and perform on the same episode (MC Hammer hosted and performed in 1991, on different episodes ).\n\nTheater of the Mind\n\nLudacris\'s 6th album, Theater of the Mind was released on November 24, 2008 it includes the singles \"What them Girls Like\" Co-Starring Chris Brown and Sean Garrett , \"One More Drink\" Co-Starring T-Pain, and \"Nasty Girl\" Co-Starring Piles. The New album peaked at 1 on U.S. Billboard Top Rap Albums and peaked at 5 on U.S. Billboard 200. \n\nActing career\n\nLudacris has been acting in film since The Wash in 2001, but his big break came in 2005, where he received critical praise for his roles in the Oscar-winning films Hustle & Flow and Crash. Crash includes an ironic sequence where Ludacris\'s character is dismissive of hip-hop music. Interestingly, in both films, he is physically beaten by characters played by Terrence Howard. He is occasionally credited as \"Chris \'Ludacris\' Bridges\".\n\nOn January 29, 2006 he was awarded with a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture for his work in the film Crash. Ludacris also starred in 2 Fast 2 Furious.Ludacris narrated the 2006 Ward Serrill basketball documentary \"Heart of the Game.\" Ludacris recently cut his trademark braids off to project a new image for his upcoming album, Release Therapy.\n\nHe recently appeared in the 28 March 2006 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Ludacris portrayed Darius Randall, the nephew of Detective Fin Tutuola, portrayed by Ice T.\n\nDisputes\n\nFurthering the controversy, in response to the signing of the Osbourne family, popular music hip-hop mogul, Russell Simmons, organized a boycott against the company. Simmons demanded an apology from Pepsi to Ludacris and a 5 million dollar donation to one of Ludacris\' charities. Eventually Simmons and Pepsi settled on an agreement to stop the boycott, right before it was to officially begin-- while Pepsi did not formally apologize to Ludacris, they did agree to donate millions of dollars over years to Russel Simmon Hip-Hop Summit Action Network.\n\nLudacris\' song \"Blow It Out\" (from the Chicken & Beer album), acted as a scathing response to his critics, namely O\'Reilly.\n\nIn another song, \"Hoes in My Room\", he tells a story about anonymous prostitutes being left in his room, and at the end of the last verse he says:\n\nThen it got to my head and Somethin\' remind me\n\nI know who let \'em in, it was Bill O\'Reilly.\n\nThen, in 2004, in \"Number 1 Spot\"\n\nRespected highly, Hi Mr. O\'Reilly.\n\nHope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with GQ magazine, Ludacris criticized Oprah Winfrey about his appearance on her show with the cast of the film Crash. During the interview, the conversation veered from the movie and Winfrey chose to speak on Ludacris\' lyrical content, which he felt was unfair as he was visiting her show in the capacity of an actor and not a rapper. Also, Ludacris was upset that some of his responses were later edited from the show\'s airing. He was later joined by other rappers such as 50 Cent, Ice Cube and Killer Mike who argued that Winfrey had an anti-hip hop bias.\n\nWinfrey responded by saying that she\'s opposed to rap lyrics that \"marginalize women,\" but enjoys some artists, including Kanye West, who appeared on her show. She said she spoke with Ludacris backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of his listeners might take it literally. Ludacris later said the media had blown his comments out of proportion and said he respects Winfrey and considers her \"a great individual.\"\n\nIn 2004, before the release of his debut album Straight Outta Ca$hville, Nashville, Tennessee native and G-Unit member Young Buck would enlist the services of fellow Atlanta emcee T.I., also known as T.I.P. in his native Bankhead neighborhood of westside Atlanta. They would create a track entitled \"Stomp\" amid growing tension between Buck\'s good friend Ludacris and T.I. On the track, T.I. takes subliminal shots at Ludacris including the line \"me gettin\' beat down, that\'s ludicrous.\" Buck, immediately sensing the tension, decided before releasing the track to notify Ludacris that T.I. had mentioned him since he didn\'t want to position himself as encouraging T.I.\'s actions. Ludacris hears the track and asks Buck if he can add his own verse to which Buck agrees. The results end up being costly for T.I. as he is berated throughout Ludacris\' verse and called out by name in his last line. Representatives from T.I. notify Buck that T.I.\'s vocals will not be cleared for the album unless T.I. is allowed to change his verse, and also have Ludacris change his. Buck refuses this offer and T.I. prohibits his vocals from being used. Buck has hypeman and fellow rapper D-Tay replace T.I. on the song and D-Tay himself is eventually replaced by The Game on the official release.\n\nAlthough T.I. was removed, the street cut featuring him and Ludacris had already been leaked to DJs in Atlanta and New York. T.I. was unable to stop the track\'s distribution throughout the streets of the nation at this point. It is widely accepted that T.I. \"lost\" this battle with Ludacris easily being the victor. The beef between Ludacris and T.I. was then put to an end behind closed doors as T.I. said that the problems between them have ceased.\n\nIn 2006 however, T.I. would release his highly anticipated fourth solo album entitled KING. In his Just Blaze produced track titled \"I\'m Talkin To You,\" T.I. lyrically attacks one or more unknown targets who have widely been speculated to be either Ludacris, New Orleans emcee Lil Wayne, or Houston rapper Lil\' Flip (whom T.I. also had beef with but has since ended their animosity behind closed doors) or a combination of all three. It is still unknown whether or not T.I. was in fact battling Ludacris again or anyone else for that matter at all. A closer listen to the song, however proves that T.I. isnt dissing Ludacris. In one of T.I.s lines he quotes \"had it out with \'Cris, but he still my nigga...sat down civilized talked about it like niggas\", alluding to the sit down that he and Ludacris had to end their beef. As a matter of fact during the taping of MTV\'s My Block \'Atlanta\', T.I. and Ludacris are shown greeting each other respectfully.\n\nIn July of 2006, a track entitled \"War with God\" would see Ludacris return after some time off in movies. In the track, Ludacris goes on the offensive against an unknown rapper who has sold drugs, and makes repeated references to shooting guns in his songs, isn\'t as rich as he (Ludacris) and likes to give himself titles - all very well known characteristics and facts directly relating to T.I and Young Jeezy (or countless other less popular rappers) or the newcoming rappers Yung Joc and Young Dro. In this instance it also unknown whether or not Ludacris is indeed aiming his disses at Young Jeezy, T.I. or if the track is even a song recorded recently. Ludacris recently stated that the song was deeper than just a diss, and the song is more about him than anyone else, it\'s showing that he isn\'t just the \'cartoon entertainer\' type rapper that he has always been portrayed as, when asked about who specific rhymes were aimed at he said \"The guilty will speak\". The track has been confirmed to be a selection from Ludacris\' upcoming album Release Therapy this September. The song is not aimed at Young Jeezy as he features on the latest album. \"War with God\" uses a beat written by Don Cheegro and Dirty Harry. Hardship took over ludacris and he was under alot of stress by the end of that album.',2573019,30547719),(546,'Da Brat','Shawntae Harris (born April 14, 1974), better known as Da Brat, is an American rapper and actress.

The album was not well received compared to Brat\'s earlier work. However, the new album and new millennium did inspire an image makeover for Da Brat. Abandoning her \"gangsta\" persona, she decided to follow the trend in popular music and attempted to add to her sex appeal; the video for \"What Chu Like\" featured Da Brat and Tyrese rolling around naked on a beach.\n\nIn 2001, Brat continued her trend of being featured on other artist\'s remixes, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles chart along with rapper Ludacris on the main remix of Mariah Carey\'s \"Loverboy\" and being featured artist on Destiny\'s Child\'s \"Survivor\" remix.

A Tribe Called Quest\'s Q-Tip negotiated her a deal with Elektra Records after being impressed by a performance at New York City\'s Lyricist Lounge (at which time Digga was eight months pregnant). Q-Tip also introduced her to Busta Rhymes, who invited her to join his newly-formed Flipmode Squad crew. The deal with Elektra soon collapsed however and Digga signed to Flipmode Entertainment.

However, this was eventually put on hold for a fully-fledged solo album. However, it was long delayed, partly due to Digga switching labels from J Records to the independent Koch Records; currently a February 2006 release is planned, with the album titled Sucker Free. A single, which may or may not resurface on the album, is \"Party Gets Hot Tonight\" featuring Akon. Her follow up album that was supposed to be released on J Records was titled Everything Is a Story, and was originally scheduled to be released February 10, 2004.

His one-line opener (\"Obie Trice: Real name, no gimmicks\" - taken from his song \"Rap Name\" and referring to the lack of a rap pseudonym) on Eminem\'s lead single; \"Without Me\", off the critically-acclaimed and commercially successful The Eminem Show increased public awareness of his name and slogan.

One of the bullets entered his skull. Trice was able to drive off the expressway, where his girlfriend waved down police. He was taken to Providence Hospital and released later that day. Doctors are still contemplating whether or not to remove the bullet which entered his head, as it may be too dangerous to operate.\n\nLeaving Shady Records, current situation\n\nObie Trice left Shady Records on June 26, 2008, because of a dispute because Interscope claimed they would not fund another Obie Trice CD. This news was first put into circulation by Hip-Hop blog Urban Lookout; a few days after they broke the news, a track (Giants) leaked confirming the rumor.

The founding members of the band are Krisztián Szucs and Robert Németh, who were college classmates in the city of Esztergom. Soon Gyula Orbán and Endre Kiss joined the band as well (both former members of the Paks based band Houdinis). During this summer, sound engineer Bernhard Hahn from Stuttgart offered a helping hand to the band, and together they worked together on HS7\'s debut album Tick Tock No Fear. The album was made independently, and released privately, as the band did not yet have a recording deal. Around this time the band starts to play their first \"serious\" gigs. The band is born!\n\nIn the fall of 1995 another former member of Houdinis, Gábor Balczer, joins HS7, bring the band to a total of 5 members. Still without a record deal, the band starts work in the summer of 1996 on the album titled \"Goal\". During the Fall, Endre Kiss decides to leave the band.\n\nAfter a long and exhausting search for a record deal, the band struck a deal with the newly formed Warner Music Hungary label, a division of 1G Records, in 1997. Soon the album \"Goal\" is released, and becomes available in several retail outlets. The band also produces their first serious video clip for the track \"Wallflower\". This clip eventually is played not only in Hungary, but on some MTV Europe programs as well, a big achievement for the band.\n\n1998\nThere is a fresh batch of songs put together. The Budapest Dolls is put together in studios in Stuttgart, Germany, where they were already \"regulars\" in Bernhard\'s studios. There were also contributions from Quimby band member Szilard Balanyi.(special guest star on the album). A serious turning point occurs in the life of the band, as the first Hungarian language songs are prepared. Two of these songs \"Hiphop mjuzik\" and \"Valami\" become minor hits in the Hungarian music charts. In Fall 1998, after much searching, the band adds new member Zoltan \"Japan\" Takacs to play keyboards, who in addition to being a very talented keyboardist, also has the uncanny ability to speak Japanese, hence the nickname.\n\n1999\nMainly a low key year for the band, though HS7 do begin work on some new tracks with an eye towards releasing a new album. The band does score a very memorable gig, as they play the Budapest Kisstadion in support of the very popular REM. Guitarist Peter Buck was sufficiently impressed with the band that he asked the band for a copy of their album. He received it right away. Mike Mills then wanted a copy as well, but due to lack of supplies, Mills did not get his HS7 CD.\n\n2000\nSpring 2000, HS7 completes their first fully Hungarian language album \"Cukor\". With the production support of Neo duo, this becomes their breakthrough album, including hit songs such as the \"straight from the heart\" song \"Hol van az a krézi srác\", the dance song \"Mozdulj\", and the rocker \"Sajnálom\". \"Hol van az a krézi srác\" becomes a number one hit on the Hungarian charts in the month \"Cukor\" is released. No so-called \"alternative\" band in Hungary has achieved this since.. This was the moment that their music became far more known within Hungary, and band enjoyed much broader recognition, including successful concert tours and festival performances The bands EP \"White Lies in Hi-Fi\", containing four songs, is picked by England based publication \"Record Collector\" as \"EP of the month\".\n\n2002\nThe band prepares their longest, most complex, and diverse album titled \"Kisfilmek a nagyvilágból\". On this album you can find memorable song such as the bittersweet \"Éjszaka\", the playful hit \"Dél-Amerika\" (for which the well-known Hungarian artist, Balázs Gróf prepared a cartoon video clip for), and the jubilant \"Ezután\", as well as the epic \"A régi nóta\".\n\n2003\nHS7 plays the main stage of the Sziget festival (one of the largest music festivals in Europe), supporting international stars Fun Lovin\' Criminals.\n\n2004\nThe band spends some one and a half years working in the studio on the new album \"Szállj ki és gyalogolj\", which sees the band return to a more stripped down sound reminiscent of their first few albums. The album includes several stand out tracks, including \"Ez a szerelem\", \"Hangerő\", as well as \"Csízbörger\" and \"Taposs a szívemen\". In Spring 2005 the album receives the prestigious MAHASZ Recording Prize in the Rock Album category. A change occurs in the band line up, as HS7 and guitarist Gábor Balczer decide to part ways following the release of the album. He is replaced by long time friend Zsolt Ábrahám, former guitarist of the Szeged based band Időrablók and Neo. The new formation of HS7 starts work on new songs in Fall 2004.\n\n2005\nAs already mentioned, the album \"Szállj ki és gyalogolj\" receives in Spring 2005 the MAHASZ recording prize in the rock album category. In December 2005, the band begins work on their next studio album, which sees HS7 reunited with the sound engineer/production partner Dávid Schram, who also worked on \"Szállj ki és gyalogolj\".\n\n2006\nMuch is happening in HS7 in the start of 2006! The band is busy preparing their new album in the studio, but this work is briefly interrupted by a very exciting event. The band travels to Cannes, France due to their nomination for the higly prestigious European Breakthrough Award of the Border Breakers Awards of MIDEM by MTV Europe, MIDEM and the European Music Office. HS7 are happy to receive the nomination, and even more happy when they win the award! Winning the award is all the more impressive considering that there were more than a hundred bands contesting for the prize from the new EU member states. In May 2005, HS7 release their new album \"Tudom, hogy szeretsz titokban\". The new album, which is also the debut for guitarist Zsolt Abraham, is hailed by most music critics as the bands most accomplished and best album to date. The album is praised for its dynamic, complex, and subversive beauty. Also, the title track of the album is relased as a free EP via the internet on www.tudomhogyszeretsztitokban.com, something almost unheard of in Hungary.

Альянс','Летом 1989 года в город Санкт-Петербург приехал поступать в Университет Гуманитарных Наук ШеFF. Там он встретился с LAем, они хорошенько попили питерского пивка и решили создать танцевальную группу, которая способна была бы убрать всех в стране по брейкдансу. Необходимо напомнить, что в то время был очень популярен этот танец и часто проходили серьезные баталии, примерно раз в два месяца, практически по всем городам страны и ближнего зарубежья. ШеFF и LA целый месяц парились над названием, были прочитаны многие книги, перелистаны словари и старые писания. Таким образом, 20 сентября 1989 года было придумано название группе... \nЛегенда такова, ШеFF любил высокие тапки фирмы New Balance, LAю тоже они нравились и когда появились вторые тапки этой фирмы у ШеFFа, LA замешал их на свой пуховик. Но тапки буквально развалились на глазах и через несколько дней полностью убились. ШеFFу нравилось слово баланс, а у LAя по этому поводу возникало другое слово - Bad. И тут сразу все стало на свои места. Сегодня много улиц страны знают имя Bad Balance. \n\nНачало. Собирается группа. Первыми присоединились Лага и Сван, так был сделан первый постановочный номер - Казаки. Это был сложный танец в стиле локинг, который сразу же поставил планку Bad B. С этого момента группа занимала только первые места, никому не отдавая своего первенства. Через несколько месяцев к команде присоединились Скаля и Бармалей и совместно с ними были сделаны еще два непобедимых номера: Ленинградские ковбои и Лалыбай. С этого момента все брэйкеры страны ехали на фестивали с одной надеждой, убрать Bad Balance, но так это никому и не удалось. \n\nВ начале 1990 года в Bad B. приходит Wolf, известный, как первый ди-джей страны, который сделал аппарат для скрейча из старой Веги и груды металлолома. Начались эксперементы в рэп музыке и со своими собственными инструменталами. \n\nВесной того же года был написан первый музыкальный хит группы - Ленинград. \n\nИ уже к лету 1990 года был полностью готов первый альбом на базе домашней студии, который был назван \"Семеро одного не ждут\". Такое название было придумано, по той причине, что Михей планировал присоединиться к группе, но не мог решиться приехать из Донецка в Питер, но слава о Bad B. набирала обороты, это и сыграло решающую роль в приезде Михея. \n\nЛетом 1990 года Михей поступает со всеми другими членами группы в Университет Гуманитарных Наук. Вся команда пошла по стопам ШеFFа, так как ректором университета было дано добро на льготное поступление в ВУЗ. Ректор видел будущее за этими парнями. Он обещал сделать концерты группы в США, в качестве культурного обмена между университетами. Все хотели получить высшее образование, поэтому решение было принято мгновенно. К первому октябрю 90 года была готова первая в России 45 минутная костюмированная танцевальная программа. Теперь в группе насчитывалось 7 человек. \n\nВ стране гремела перестройка, есть было нечего, культура умирала, а группа пыталась оформить документы на выезд в США. В то время выехать за границу вообще было проблематично, поэтому МИД с легкостью завернул дело и выбросил в мусорное ведро. В начале осени удалось выехать в Америку только лидеру Bad Balance - ШеFFу, где он пробыл почти три месяца, тщетно пытаясь сделать повторное приглашение группе. МИД после того раза, еще трижды отказал парням в выезде. Ректор университета ничего не мог сделать и только разводил руками. ШеFFу тем не менее удалось получить от крупной Вашингтонской продюсерской компании серьезное приглашение, с которым он вернулся в Россию. \n\nК этому времени Wolf покинул группу и занялся своим сольным проектом - \"Имя Защищено\", куда вошли Марамой и Кефир. Несмотря на это, было принято решение писать рэп альбом. Все зарабатывали, как могли и приносили в общую кассу свои сбережения для записи. Было очень трудно. Запись началась на студии ДДТ, а позже продолжилась на студии Эдиты Пьехи. Первая композиция была - \"Донецкий Край\", она отдавала настоящим, теперь уже русским рэпом. \n\nВ конце года состоялся первый отечественный рэп фестиваль - РЭП-ПИК`90, где Bad B. именно с этой композицией заняла первое место. На Питерском фестивале участвовали так же группы: Академия-2, Термоядерный Джем, МД&C Павлов, Дубовый Гаайъ, Имя Защищено и другие. Было очевидно, что рэп взял верх над брэйкдансом и необходимо было искать новые пути прививания хип-хоп культуры. \n\nК началу 1991 года МИД поставил разрешение группе на выезд в США, но на этот раз Американское консульство не дало разрешение на выезд. Не смотря на это, Bad Balance был занят работой над альбомом \"Выше Закона\". Название этого альбома было придумано после многократных отказов на выезд. Последние телеги к альбому, были дописаны на студии группы Форум. Полное непонимание работников студии серьезно раздражало участников Bad B., поэтому в один прекрасный момент они набили морду звукорежисеру и потребовали его заменить на другого. Отказать им было трудно, режиссер был заменен, но в Питерской среде поп исполнителей прокатилась волна неприятия рэп музыки в целом. Не надо забывать, что в то время правила поп музыка, а рок музыка была слишком далека от новой культуры и не в коем образе не хотела идти на контакт. Существовал вакуум или Ленинградская блокада. Тем не менее, к лету был полностью записан альбом и выброшен на рынок через пиратскую сеть, так как официальная дистрибьюция в стране не работала вообще. Впервые в стране, группой была создана коллекция одежды, которая выражалась только в тишетах и кенгурухах с логотипом Bad Balance - Abowe the low. Обратите внимание на то, что в английском написании существует две ошибки, которые сделаны специально, чтобы отличаться в правописании от известной американской рэп группы из Лос-Анжелеса - Above the law. Три сотни первых тишетов разлетелись среди друзей и знакомых. \n\nВ августе 1991 года Bad Balance получает гран-при на Всероссийском Рэп Фестивале, который был сделан Студией Класс и Артемием Троицким в Парке Культуры. Господин Троицкий позже сказал, что эти парни знают, что такое рэп и по энергетики их смело можно сравнить с Американской группой Public Enemy. Это заключение наверняка было сделано после того, как был исполнен первый вариант композиции - \"Дети Сатаны\". Да, действительно текст отвечал действительности, а вот продакшн (музыка) не куда не годился. В любом случае, каждый кто видел это действие на сцене, подходил и выражал свое уважение группе. Именно после этого фестиваля, многие заговорили о том, что рэп на русском языке невозможен, что это всего лишь подражание черным афроамериканцам, у которых стиль жизни сильно отличается от нашего. Люди не хотели соглашаться с тем, что страна меняется и видели в группе Bad B. врагов или спецагентов с запада. Поэтому полностью игнорировали и не давали развиваться живой уличной культуре. Но все-таки клоунаду, синтетически придуманную, некоторые умники начали проталкивать. Так, на сцену готовили к выходу Богдана Титомира и группу Мальчишник. Но это все будет в будущем. \n\nПо возвращении в родной город состоялось несколько съемок на Питерском телевидении и прошло промо на местных радиостанциях. Таким образом весь прогрессивный Питер знал, что в их городе есть, как и во всем мире рэп, и не просто рэп, а лучший в стране рэп. Именно после этого нашелся человек, который сказал, что готов поддержать финансами группу. Его звали Андрей Бережной, его бизнес - фабрика по пошиву модных в то время плащей. Он зарабатывал много денег на том, что не приносило ему удовлетворения и поэтому он искал хоть малую возможность изменить мир одинаковых плащей. А. Бережной вел переговоры по съемке документального фильма о группе. Картина была запланирована на весну будущего года. Со второй половины осени и до весны следующего года прошло около 20 концертов в Питере и других городах. Один участник коллектива серьезно занялся граффити и дизайном и все меньше уделял внимания танцу. Однажды он почувствовал, что ему лучше найти себя в дизайне. Все парни высказали ему огромное уважение, за то, что он сделал для хип-хопа в свои годы и закатили классные проводы. Этим человеком оказался - Богдан. Тем временем на заработанные с концертов деньги, были заказаны за границей модные свитшеты, тишеты, ветровки и бейсболки модной в то время среди Американских рэперов, команды - Riders, а так же навороченные тапки Nike. В то же время, для группы бесплатно были сшиты черные слаксы и плащи на базе первого спонсора отечественного рэпа. Теперь группа выглядела серьезно и стала понемногу пугать поп артистов. \n\nВесной 1992 года было принято решение записать настоящий рэп альбом с качественным звучанием и более уличной лирикой. Команда разделилась на две части, одна отвечала за танец (Лага, Swan, Скаля), а другая за рэп (LA, Михей, ШеFF). Андрей Бережной познакомил ШеFFа, с мастером международного класса по кик-боксингу - Александром Савиновым, который тренировал в своей школе лучших кик-боксеров города и готовил их к международным соревнованиям. Вникнув в суть хип-хопа, он предложил свой зал для репетиций Bad Balance, а так же давал уроки кик-боксинга парням. Так, за короткое время группа подружилась с замечательными спортсменами и в свою очередь подсадила их на рэп музыку. Теперь крыша для группы стала не нужна, потому как все спортсмены города готовы были любого порвать за Bad B. Начинала зарождаться правда улиц. Пришло время разделиться, половина группы ехала писать альбом. Путь лежал в Москоу Сити, в студию Gala-Records. Деньги на запись альбома были получены у Андрея Бережного. \n\nЗапись началась, в самой лучшей в то время студии - Gala, в конце апреля. Парни в составе ШеFFа, LAя и Михея, остановились в гостинице Измайловская и каждый день в течении двух месяцев шла работа над новым альбомом - \"Налетчики Bad B.\" В студии познакомились с Богданом Титомиром, который в то время гремел по всей стране со своей необоснованной выдумкой - Высокая Энергия. Встреча была резкой, как в уличных боевиках, так как Bad B. не приветствовали ничего, что могло бы принести ущерб их делу - хип-хоп культуре. Но пообщавшись с Богданом, поняли, что правильней будет объединится и повернуть историю развития уличной музыки в нормальное русло. Он мог им дать возможность донести их идеи до большего числа людей, а они могли ему подсказать, что есть настоящий рэп. По Москве пошел слух, что Питерские парни делают реальное дерьмо, которое во всем мире начинает резко набирать обороты. Так, известный московский промоутер Игорь Селеверстов, почувствовав золотую жилу, предложил группе выступать в его клубе - Jump. Об этом клубе знала вся Москва и попасть туда было очень престижно любому обывателю или моднику. Парни подписали контракт на четыре месяца о выступлении в клубе - три раза в неделю и следовательно получали $1200 в месяц. Начинался первый реальный рэп бизнес. После возвращения в Питер обнаружилось, что два бойца из отряда, хотят уйти налево, якобы в серьезный бизнес. Как только ни старались ШеFF и LA удержать парней, но ничего не получилось. Из группы ушел Swan и Лага. Теперь состав Bad Balance был таким: ШеFF, LA, Михей, Скаля и Моня. Ощущалась нехватка еще в одном танцоре. И ровно через два дня появился Тимир, выходец из Питера и представитель новой волны брэйкданса. Он был принят, так как имел высокий авторитет в танцевальном Питере. Группа приобрела новый ореол. Были сшиты костюмы из рабочей ткани, в стиле питерских заключенных. Кстати, известная линия одежды Roca Wear, только в начале 2000 года начала выпускать похожие модели из аналогичной ткани. Шли выступления в клубе Jump, группу реально признали. На вырученные деньги ШеFF предложил купить первую командную машину - Жигули (четверку). Эта тачка реально была боевой машиной пехоты, потому что все учились водить.

Eventually settling in Portland, Maine he quickly gained popularity among the disconnected youth and in 1999 began performing at local hip-hop clubs as Poverty and releasing promotional CDs. His album \"Rise From Ruin\" found its way to Columbia Records in Hollywood, California where Thommy signed on to be a songwriter. \n\nWhile a ghostwriter Thommy continued to pursue his personal  career in music and recorded a demo with hip-hop producer Tycoon (50 Cent, Mickey Avalon, Pussy Cat Dolls). Later he landed a national tour with Lyricist Lounge and opened performances for 50 Cent, KRS ONE, DMX, Nelly, and Fabulous. Eventually Thommy’s charismatic persona clearly translated on to the big screen with a significant role in the 2006 Film, \"Waist Deep\" (Tyrese Gibson, The Game, Megan Good). \n\nIn the wake of his mother\'s tragic sudden death Thommy returned to Maine. He found himself back on the streets bouncing between shelters and squatting in the basements of abandoned apartment buildings. This dark period unleashed some of the most prolific music of Thommy\'s young career. Reliving the life which had sparked his creativity in the first place he realized it was too late to save his mother but it was possible to save himself and get back on track. \n\nLetting go of the moniker \"Poverty\" his new project was simply self-titled \"Thommy\". The song “I Don’t Wanna Grow Up” portrays the mischievous and poetic carefree lifestyle that fueled his imagination as a child. \n\nCurrently producing as \"ThommyKane he continues to defy the typical hip-hop classification with vivid lyrics and anthemic overtones retorting the voice of the \"I-pod\" generation having no musical limits.\n\nSuperhuman\nWhitebread\nRise From Ruin (The Red Album)\nKill Krissy\nBeef (Soundtrack and extra disc)',1049,13552),(623,'Yosumi','',1122,12223),(624,'Mr Salek','',4,41),(625,'Maxwell Price','',34,78),(626,'Total Devastation','There are two artists with the name Total Devastation:\n\n1.

Desiring to update the synth-based sound they had pioneered earlier, and anxious to explore a more guitar-driven and socio-politically-oriented genre of music, the band put out ’The Healing Time’ in 1994, an album which was comprised of a dozen new tracks, ranging stylistically from alt-country/Americana to folk-rock to modern blues. Venturing out to play live, both as a duo and with the addition of various musicians and friends, the band - which has been compared by critics to acts ranging from Fleetwood Mac to Pretenders to REM - was a regular part of New York City’s Greenwich Village music scene during the mid-to-late 1990s. In the autumn of 1999, the pair released the ‘best of’ album ’Songs of Simple Dreams,’ an amalgam of re-claimed earlier songs and new Smoke Rings Days compositions. ‘Sins of Commission’ and ‘Da Capo,’ two collections of new and previously-unreleased material, followed in 2001, the year the band acquired their state-of-the-art digital studio. Since that time, the creative collaborators have busy composing and recording, working on two projects simultaneously, the political pop of Smoke Ring Days and the trippy world beats that comprise their other side projects, samples of which can be found on this website.

He is best known for his work with Talib Kweli on his Reflection Eternal album and on Black Star.\n\nEarly career\nHi-Tek started his rap career with hip hop group Mood and had a regional hit with \"Hustle on the Side\". That song was made for Mood\'s album Doom, which featured amongst others Brooklyn MC Talib Kweli. Talib and Hi-Tek clicked immediately, and Hi-Tek went on to produce most of Talib Kweli and Mos Def\'s Black Star (1998). In 2000, Tek and Kweli (under the name Reflection Eternal) released Train of Thought (2000) on Rawkus Records, with raps by Talib Kweli and beats by Hi-Tek. It enjoyed moderate crossover radio success with the single \"The Blast\" and eventually earned Gold status in record sales. The pair have yet to release a follow-up album due to creative differences.\n\nCurrent career\nAfter signing to Rawkus Records, Tek produced for some of their projects, including the popular Soundbombing series, a three-record compilation of Rawkus artists. During his tenure there, he grew unhappy with their treatment of him, such as a time they forced him to give a beat he\'d produced for Snoop Dogg to label signee Kool G Rap, who didn\'t want the beat.\n\nIn 2001, he released his solo album Hi-Teknology on Rawkus. The album featured raps by artists like Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Vinia Mojica, Buckshot, and others, all produced by Hi-Tek. It received some critical acclaim and spawned a minor hit \"Round and Round\" with Cincinnati singer Jonell.\n\nAlthough the record sold over 250,000 copies, Hi-Tek wasn\'t pleased with the job Rawkus did with his album, and he left the label shortly after its release. He then signed to MCA Records after the song \"Round and Round\" became an underground hit. While signed to MCA, Hi-Tek produced the album Hi-Teknology 2 and produced Jonell\'s debut album for Def Jam, though neither of these albums were released.\n\nCurrently, Hi-Tek is working as a staff producer for Aftermath Entertainment and its affiliates, as well as past associates such as Kweli and Mos Def.

He first appeared on albums from The Beatnuts on the track \"Off the Books\" and on Fat Joe\'s second album Jealous One\'s Envy, on the track \"Watch Out\", prior to signing to Loud Records as a solo artist. Big Pun\'s career was cut short in 2000 at age 28 by a fatal heart attack due to his obesity. He is survived by a wife, Liza Rios, and three children. Big Pun was the first solo Latino rapper to sell over one million LPs. His first stage name was Big Moon Dawg. His name comes from the Marvel comic book anti-hero The Punisher.\n\nChildhood\n\nBorn in the South Bronx of Puerto Rican descent during the early years of hip-hop, Christopher Rios grew up enjoying basketball, boxing, and other sports. He met his wife Liza in the eighth grade. At the age of five, he broke his leg in a Manhattan municipal park, resulting in a lawsuit against the City of New York, later settled out of court. He received a lot of money in compensation. By all accounts from Pun\'s family, his early years were very difficult, including witnessing his mother\'s drug abuse, his father leaving the family, and a stepfather who was very hard on Pun. According to his grandmother, Pun would become angry and self-destructive, punching holes in the walls of his family\'s apartment and eating the chunks of drywall rocks . At the age of 17, Rios dropped out of Stevenson High School and for some time was homeless, staying in abandoned buildings or at friends\' homes.\n\nCareer\n\nSometime during the \'80s, he formed the Full a Clips Crew with Triple Seis, Prospect and Cuban Link who was at the time named \"Lyrical Assassin\". At this point Big Pun was operating under the alias Big Moon Dawg. Rios met fellow Puerto Rican and Bronx rapper Fat Joe in 1995 and made his commercial debut on Joe\'s second album, Jealous One\'s Envy, in addition to appearing on a b-side to Joe\'s \"Envy\" single, \"Fire Water.\"\n\nLater, \"I\'m Not a Player\" (featuring an O\'Jays sample) was supported by a significant advertising campaign and became an underground hit. The song\'s remix, \"Still Not a Player\" (featuring Joe), became Big Pun\'s first major mainstream hit. His full-length debut Capital Punishment followed in 1998, and was the first album by a solo Latino rapper to go platinum, peaking at #5 on the Billboard 200. Capital Punishment was also nominated for a Grammy, but lost out on the award to Jay-Z\'s Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life. He became a member of The Terror Squad, a New York-based group of rappers founded by Fat Joe, with most of the roster supplied by the now-defunct Full a Clips Crew.\n\nDeath\n\nDespite his athletic adolescence, Big Pun struggled with his weight for most of his life; his weight fluctuated in the early 90\'s between obese and morbidly obese. In the last years of his life he fluctuated between 450 and 697 pounds. Big Pun enrolled in a weight-loss program in North Carolina, in which he lost 100 pounds, but he eventually quit the program before completing it, returning to New York and gaining back the weight he had lost. On February 7, 2000, Big Pun suffered a fatal heart attack and respiratory failure in a hotel, Crowne Plaza, in White Plains, NY.\n\n\nPosthumous works\n\nHis second album, Yeeeah Baby, completed before his death, was issued as scheduled in April 2000. It peaked at #3 on the Billboard charts and earned gold record status within three months of its release. It eventually went platinum. A second posthumous album, Endangered Species, was released in April of 2001. Endangered Species collected some of Pun\'s \"greatest hits,\" previously unreleased material, numerous guest appearances, and remixed \"greatest verses.\" As with his other albums, it also peaked in the top ten of the Billboard 200, reaching #7, but didn\'t sell as much as the previous Pun albums had.\n\nIn recent times, Big Punisher was featured with Fat Joe on \"Duets: The Final Chapter,\" an album of tracks featuring the Notorious B.I.G, also deceased. The track \"Get Your Grind On\" begins with a Big Pun radio interview in which he said he would perform a duet with Biggie at the gates of heaven. Punisher was also featured on a track from the revived Terror Squad\'s second album, True Story, on the track \"Bring \'Em Back\" with Big L.\n\nSony Records has been considering releasing a second posthumous album featuring unreleased material, but the project is being delayed by Sony. Liza Rios also held an auction in 2005 for her deceased husband\'s Terror Squad medallion, citing financial difficulties in the wake of Pun\'s death, and again claiming to have not received any royalty checks for Pun\'s posthumous album sales (save for a small check from the sales of Endangered Species).\n\nLyrical ability and technique\n\nBig Pun rapped at high speeds. He used huge multies and internal rhyme schemes. He showcased his punchline capabilities on \'Dream Shatterer\', multies and flow in \'Twinz\', \'You ain\'t a Killer\' and \'Boomerang\'. He was influenced heavily by Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane. He also showcased superior topic versatility ranging from street life to sex/relationships and politics to social injustice.',683612,7772067),(646,'Killarmy','Killarmy (pronounced Killa Army) is an American hip hop group, most well-known through their affiliation with the Wu-Tang Clan. They are one of the earliest and most successful of the many Wu-Tang affiliates that emerged in the mid-to-late 1990\'s. Originally consisting of New York rappers 9th Prince (RZA\'s younger brother), Islord, Dom Pachino, Killa Sin and Ohio producer 4th Disciple, they added Beretta 9 and ShoGun Assasson to the roster in 1996, also from Ohio. They distinguish themselves from the other affiliates with gritty subject matter, differing from the standard subject matter of martial arts common to Wu-Tang and their affilates and focusing on themes of military and combat.\n\nKillarmy released numerous singles from 1995 to 1997, including \"Swinging Swords\" and \"Camouflage Ninjas\" as well as the Sunz Of Man collaborations \"Wake Up\" and \"Soldiers of Darkness\". The album Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars was released in 1997 just after the release of the Wu-Tang Clan\'s second album, as well as a 12\" single containing two tracks from the album, \"Wu-Renegades\" and \"Clash of the Titans\". Shortly after the group\'s manager General Wise was shot dead in Steubenville, but the group pressed on undeterred, appearing on the Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm compilation and each making numerous appearances on other Wu-Tang projects from the Clansmen themselves and from other affiliates. The group\'s second album Dirty Weaponry was released in 1998 and the third, Fear, Love & War was released on September 11, 2001. In 2002, the group received some controversy following the Washington D.C. sniper attacks. On an episode of Tim Russert\'s Meet the Press, Russert and Montgomery County police chief Charles Moose stated that Killarmy influenced the shootings, and referenced a number of lyrics to support the claims. Despite the press attention, nothing materialized from the accusations. In 2002, Dom Pachino became the first group member to release a solo album, with Tera Iz Him. 9th Prince followed in 2003 with his solo debut Granddaddy Flow.

In 1987, the trio consisted of Dominican-American Louise Sabater (who is also known as Angel Clivillés), Caroline Jackson and Sunshine Wright. They were the one of the first acts to bring freestyle music to the pop charts, having a string of moderate hits in the late eighties. Their debut album \"Show Me\" produced five Billboard Hot 100 chart entries: \"Show Me\" (#44), \"Spring Love\" (#98), \"Because Of You\" (#27), \"Promise Me\" (#40) and \"Inside Outside\" (#55). The album and its singles are considered early classics of this musical genre.\n\nIn 1989, Wright was replaced by Margo Urban and more hits followed. Their sophomore album \"We Can\'t Go Wrong\" includes the lead single \"My Heart Skips a Beat\" climbed to #38 on the Billboard Hot 100. The ballad title track \"We Can\'t Go Wrong\" became their first Top 10 hit, peaking at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nBy 1992 the trio had more lineup chages: Jackson was the only remaining original member. New members were Evelyn Escalera and Michelle Valentine. Preceeding the released of The Cover Girls third album, \"Here It Is\", they scored their second Top 10 hit followed (\"Wishing On A Star\" #9 Pop & #7 Dance) and \"Thank You\" (#75 Pop). The albums\' other singles are \"Don\'t Stop Now\" (#63 Pop & #8 Dance) and by \"Funk Boutique\" (#55 Pop & #8 Dance) and \"If You Want My Love (Here It Is)\" (#8 Dance). \"Don\'t Stop Now\" is noted as the first song to feature the lead vocals of Evelyn Escalera. \n\nWith the release of The Cover Girls\' fourth album \"Satisfy\" in 1996, the lead vocal duties were performed by Michelle Valentine.

Known as “The Voice of New York”, her afternoon radio show has consistently been ranked #1 with more young listeners than any other radio program in the country.\n\nAngie Martinez got her first break in radio at the age of 16 answering hot lines at the urban radio station WQHT (\"Hot 97\"). There she met popular DJ Funkmaster Flex, and began working as his protégé. Martinez quickly picked up on the craft of running a successful radio program. Executives at the station decided to give her a chance, even though she lacked on-air experience.\n\nAs an actress, Angie received small roles in independent hip hop films such as Blood is Thicker Than Water and Paper Soldiers. She then appeared in Brown Sugar starring Taye Diggs, Queen Latifah and Sanaa Lathan.\n\nIn 1996, Martinez was encouraged to give rapping a shot by friend KRS-One. She appeared on his track \"Heartbeat\" from his 1997 album I Got Next. After the song gained a strong fan following, another friend, Lil\' Kim, offered her a spot on the \"Ladies Night Remix\" of her song \"Not Tonight\" for the Nothing to Lose soundtrack. Along with Missy Elliott, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes and Da Brat, the ladies enjoyed one of the most successful singles of 1997. It peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at #2, and reached #1 on the Hip-Hop / R&B charts and the Rap charts respectively. The single sold over 1,000,000 copies and was certified Platinum. The ladies were nominated for two Grammy Awards that year, and were also invited to perform the song live on The MTV Video Music Awards. A major label battle began to sign Martinez to a recording contract. Her appearance on other rapper\'s material was in high demand. She recorded songs with Mary J. Blige (\"Christmas in the City\"), Terror Squad (\"Freak Out\"), N.O.R.E. (\"Oh No Remix\"), Beenie Man (\"Tell Me Remix\") and Funkmaster Flex & Big Kap\'s compilation album The Tunnel (\"Wow\"). She also recorded interludes for mixtapes by Kid Capri, DJ Clue and DJ Kayslay. In 2001, she appeared in the music video for Jay-Z and R. Kelly\'s \"Guilty Until Proven Innocent\".\n\nOn April 17, 2001, she finally issued her oft-delayed debut album, Up Close and Personal. The album included production by DJ Clue, Salaam Remi, Knobody and RocWilder among others, and featured guest appearances by Jay-Z, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Wyclef Jean, Busta Rhymes and Kool G. Rap. The first single, \"Dem Thangzzz\" was produced by The Neptunes, and also featured background vocals by Pharrell Williams and Q-Tip. The track failed to make a strong impression at radio, but the album enjoyed strong first week sales. It debuted at #32 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart, and #10 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Charts selling 69,000 its first week. The second single, \"Coast 2 Coast\" (Suavamente) featuring rapper Wyclef Jean re-sparked interest in the album. She promoted the album with magazine posters, in-store signings, club appearances and television appearances with MTV and BET. The record received mixed reviews from critics, but like Martinez herself, was strongly accepted in the hip hop community. The album sold a low 325,000 units.\n\nFollowing her first album\'s release, Angie began work on a second record Animal House. In order to build anticipation for the record, she appeared on BET\'s Rap City and began a nation-wide radio tour. She recorded a verse for the remix to her Artist Sacario record \"Live Big\". It became the number one record in the tri-state area and coincidentally coincided with the release of Martinez\'s first single from her second album, \"If I Could Go\" which also featured Sacario and singer Lil\' Mo. \"If I Could Go\" became a huge crossover hit on pop radio, climbing into the top 10 on The Billboard Hot 100 Chart. It became the #1 played on urban radio in 2002. The album, Animal House (named after Martinez\'s own production company and recording posse), was released on August 21, 2002. It entered the Billboard Hot 200 Albums Chart at #11, and the Billboard Hot Hip-Hop / R&B Charts selling 92,000 units in its first week. The follow-up single, \"Take You Home\" featuring R&B singer Kelis didn\'t receive as much attention, but it did become a minor hit that winter. The album was more strongly received by critics and fans. Following the release of the album, she was featured on a remix for labelmate Lil\' Mo\'s track \"Gangster\", and Nina Sky\'s hype single \"Time to Go\". Following this she announced she was retiring from the recording industry to concentrate on her other projects.\n\nShe has a son Niko Ruffin (born June 12, 2003) with Tamir \"Nokio\" Ruffin of Dru Hill.',42569,215748),(652,'tech-hop concepts','',5,7),(653,'Master Plan Allstarz','',61,297),(654,'Jamie Dunlap','Jamie Dunlap is an American composer.

In total, they have released six studio albums, 2000\'s Mind Over Matter, 2003\'s Deep Water Slang V2.0, 2005\'s True & Livin\', 2006\'s Break a Dawn (a Japan exclusive), also in 2006 an album with The Grouch, Heroes in the City of Dope, 2009\'s The Take Over, 2010\'s Atomic Clock, and their newest collaborative album with The Grouch, \'Heroes in the Healing of the Nation\'.\n\nAfter signing with independent label Ground Control Records, the duo released their debut single \"Inner Light\" in 1998, along with their debut EP Starship. In 1999, they released their next single \"Critical\" featuring Planet Asia, and another EP, Chapter 4. Their debut album Mind Over Matter  finally surfaced in 2000. The effort was one of the most critically acclaimed underground albums of the year, and was nominated for Independent Album of the Year by The Source Magazine. AmpLive\'s futuristic production techniques and Zumbi\'s strong and substantial lyrical content were a major hit with underground Hip Hop fans.\n\nZion I recorded a second album titled Deep Water Slang, set for release in 2002, but their label went under and the album disappeared. They prepared a second version, Deep Water Slang V2.0, which was released in early 2003. Music videos were shot for the songs \"The Drill\", \"Finger Paint\", \"Boom Bip\" and \"Le Le Le\", giving them the most exposure of their career. Zion I started their own record label, Live Up Records, in 2003, and released a mixtape titled Curb Servin. In 2004, the duo released a compilation titled Politicks, and another mixtape, Family Business, which served as a prelude to their anticipated third album. They were featured along with Del tha Funkee Homosapien and Haiku D\'Etat on the CD/DVD Calicomm 2004.\n\nTrue & Livin\' was released in early 2005, featuring guest appearances from popular underground artists like Talib Kweli, Aesop Rock, Del tha Funkee Homosapien and Gift of Gab. The album featured the single \"The Bay,\" became a West Coast/College Radio hit, and featured a music video. The remix of \"The Bay\" earned the group its first significant commercial radio play in the San Francisco Bay area. The remix, and later projects, represent a concerted effort to reach hyphy audiences, by collaborating with artists such as Turf Talk, San Quinn, and Mistah F.A.B..\n\nThe duo\'s fifth album is a collaboration project with Living Legends member The Grouch, titled Heroes in the City of Dope, and was released on October 10, 2006. This fifth album was again highly critically acclaimed, and gained the talented band more artistic respect. \n\nTheir song \"Spinning\" was included in the soundtrack of the movie Grandma\'s Boy.\n\nZion I\'s song \"Go Hard\" was the feature song in popular video game NBA Live 10.',305663,4544192),(690,'Queen Pen','Queen Pen (born Lynise Walters in 1973 in Brooklyn, New York), is an American female rapper.\n\nWalters\' music career started with help from Teddy Riley, music producer and member of the R&B group Blackstreet in the mid 1990s.

A year later they released their first album titled Zakon. The album gained positive reception for its unique sound and it is considered a classic in Rijeka\'s metal history.\n\n2001 saw their second and last album Nelogični. The album was not a great success like its predecessor and had a bad promotion from its label. After the album, Unlogic Skill disbanded.\n\nThe band didn\'t have a specific style, they used combinations of rap, rock, nu-metal and rap metal. At first, they rapped only in English later using combinations of English and Croatian before rapping only in Croatian.\n\nThe band had a short reunion while filming hip hop documentary \"Hip Hop priča iz Hrvatske\" in 2008. That same year, former front-man Damir Badurina committed suicide in his high club.',199,2890),(692,'Restiform Bodies','A mysterious and highly experimental hip-hop group, Restiform Bodies deconstruct rap with the same approach that bands like Sonic Youth and Swans took toward punk in the early \'80s. Often harsh, moody, and quite bizarre, the troupe is made up of songwriter/vocalist David Bryant (Passage); percussionist and beatmaker Matt Valerio (the Bomarr Monk); and synth, sample, and effects slayer George Chadwick (Telephone Jim Jesus). Inspired by electronica, ghetto-tech, prog rock, and vintage R&B, the group took an aggressively inspired view of the genre, taking alternative rap beyond the fringes already established by Kool Keith and Cannibal Ox. Often sounding more like Stereolab than any other point of reference, the group\'s unique sound and image led to a deal with Anticon Records (a collective that Bryant belongs to), which released their 2002 eponymous debut, as well as 2008\'s TV Loves You Back. ~ Bradley Torreano, Rovi\n\nRestiform Bodies are David Bryant-vocalist and song writer, Matt Valerio- percussionist and beat-maker & George Chadwick-synth, sample and effects slayer. In 2000 they made a tape called \"Oubliette,\" and caught the attention of Oakland\'s then young experimental hip hop collective, anticon. Once in Oakland RB began what they refer to affectionately as an adventure in \"total career ambivalence\".Repeatedly dodging the bullet of a follow up to their S/T release on anticon\'s deceased in-house distributor and label imprint, 6 months distribution, the three focused instead on developing songs for performance with live electronics, resulting in a metric ton of songs and zero grams of vinyl. The joke is that the three can seldom be found in the same room, even though they lived together for all intents and purposes throughout high school, which may ironically be the puzzle buster of their story. Since 2000 Restiform Bodies have toured in support of their self titled LP (an organized version of the bedroom cassette) and their various individual projects. They have each recorded at the very least one solo release, and at last their debut record for anticon, TV LOVES YOU BACK, which may or may not pay off the computer. \n\nSound check casualties include but are not limited to: Sole, Dose One, Alias, Why?

His career has spanned over 24 years, during which he has released eleven albums. According to the He\'s a Mental Giant Songfacts, his stage name originated from the TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun, given to him by rapper Black Walt due to his fast rhyming style. (Tech is short for technique and 9 is the number of completion. That\'s why he says the technique\'s complete so often.)\n\nHis tenth studio album, K.O.D., was released October 27, 2009. He has spent his illustrious career making sure he’s been grinding harder than the average rapper, and is the best selling artist out of his hometown. With nine solo albums and two powerhouse collaboration projects under his belt, the Kansas City MC’s flow is sharper and slicker than it’s ever been.\n“This is another roller coaster ride,” explains TECH N9NE about the release.  “When it came time for Sickology 101, I knew I wanted to do a collabo album based on the study of being sick. It’s a beginner’s course for people who don’t know how to be sick lyrically or how to choose sick beats. It all starts with beats because they tell me exactly what to do.” Epic beats from YoungFyre, Wyshmaster, Seven and Matic Lee set the stage for TECH N9NE to weave his introspective and sometimes roguish lyrics around. \n\nSickology 101 brims with stellar appearances from lyrical heavyweights. On the opening title track, TECH N9NE slays alongside Chino XL and Crooked I, pulling listeners into the Hip-Hop classroom for a lesson in murdering a beat. It’s a twisted vision forged on undeniable grooves and quixotic wordplay. \n\nThe single, “Nothin,’” is an inspiring, honest anthem that features Messy Marv and Big Scoob. Meanwhile, on “Midwest Choppers 2,” TECH N9NE and Krayzie Bone cruise to the depths of darkness. “Krayzie Bone came through and murdered it,” says TECH N9NE. “I modeled the song after movies. When you do a sequel, there has to be a bigger body count and more people have to die. ‘Midwest Choppers 2’ is Autobahn-style. It makes you want to speed.” \n\nTECH N9NE’s inimitable flow and rhyming take center stage on solo tracks, including the haunting, hypnotic “Red Nose.” He doesn’t pull any punches on the vitriolic, YoungFyre-produced “Blown Away,” either. It’s an open letter to several prominent urban artists who refused to play before him at radio festivals despite his massive concert draw. \n\nWith hits like “I’m A Playa,” “Caribou Lou” (which boasts 7.2 million MySpace plays), “Riotmaker,” “Like Yeah” and “Everybody Move,” it’s no wonder TECH N9NE counts a total of over 4.5 million YouTube video plays and an average of 40,000 MySpace visitors each day. His success knows no limits. The July 2008 release, Killer, debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart and Number 12 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. He did it all on his own. There was no major label — just TECH N9NE’s own record company, Strange Music. TECH N9NE’s tracks have appeared in films like Gang Related and Alpha Dog as well as various TV shows, and he recently made his motion picture debut in The Life of Lucky Cucumber alongside members of MTV’s “Jackass” crew. \n\nIt hasn’t been an easy road, but TECH N9NE soldiers on and he’ll never stop. “They call me devil worshipper because I’m different. I give you music for my core. They’re the people that put me over the million mark. I raise my middle finger to everybody who judges me because my core audience is there for me. They will always love me, but I’m trying to reach others, too. It’s not over. My music is supposed to be for everybody, but some people just don’t get it. This album is the result; swallow it. It’s middle finger music, all-day and all-night.” \n\nTECH N9NE never stops bringing that music directly to his fans, constantly reinforcing his status as one of the hardest-touring rap acts in the business.  In 2008, TECH N9NE performed over 200 shows and he doesn’t show any signs of slowing down in 2009.  In April, TECH will head out in support of Sickology 101 and spend two months on the road, performing live for his rabid fans.   \n\nSickology 101 is prepping the world for TECH N9NE’s next masterpiece, K.O.D. “I want people to know that I’m getting better and better and I’m a machine. I do these collabo albums to give the fans more. This is a bridge record to K.O.D. It’s the farewell to the TECH N9NE you’ve known lately. It’s getting darker. A lot of people might not be able to go to the place I’m going, but this place is my specialty.” \n\n“I don’t need people to kiss my hand,” assures TECH N9NE. “I’m not trippin’ on status, and I’m not a narcissist when it comes to rap. It’s my heart and soul pouring onto the paper. I write my life and I can’t hold back. This is what I know.”\n\nOrigin: Kansas City, Missouri\nYear Formed: 1991\nOfficial Site: http://www.therealtechn9ne.com/',1117423,27746869),(696,'K.I.D. of Darkroom Familia','',13,69),(697,'Mino','There are four artists with this name:\n\n1.

A house-centric alter-ego of Praveen Sharma (of Sepalcure, Praveen & Benoît)\n2. MC from Portland, Oregon.\n3. Hardcore band, probably active in the 90\'s.\n4. A hardcore punk band from Philadelphia, PA that has been active since 2012. http://braillephiladelphia.bandcamp.com/\n\n1) As the house-oriented solo project of Praveen Sharma (see Sepalcure, Praveen, and Praveen & Benoit), Braille combines classic chicago house vocals with deep, dubby melodic elements, all under the pulse of post-dubstep-influenced, sub-dominating bass. His debut EP, The Year 3000, is slated for a May, 2011 release on Rush Hour.\n\n2) Always on a musical mission, BRAILLE has become one of rap’s best-kept secrets.  He has released three solo albums, performed throughout the U.S., Europe and Japan with artists like the late James Brown, De La Soul and others, been named one of the “Next 100” by URB magazine and collaborated with rap heavyweights such as 9th Wonder, CunninLyguists, and Pigeon John.  All of these accomplishments set the stage for Braille’s fourth album, the splendid The IV Edition (Syntax Records).\n\nIn addition to being his fourth album, the title represents three other things.   Braille wants the album to serve as an IV to distribute musical medicine for social illnesses directly into the veins of the society.  IV also stands for “International Vision” (becoming more aware of what\'s going on in the world around us) and “International Version” (the album is made for an international audience and features German, French, Finish and Australian producers like M-Phazes, Aetoms, Staffro, etc).\n\nThe album’s title song serves as an ode to Braille’s rap roots.  Produced by Marco Polo and featuring scratches from Rob Swift, the energetic, drum-driven tune is a lyrical showcase that caters to rap’s tremendous subterranean following.  “The underground hip-hop base is a lot bigger than people think it is,” Braille reveals.  “Sometimes when people think of the word underground, they think of basement albums that just get dubbed on tape.  So I’m sticking to my roots.  I believe that the audience for lyricism and good hip-hop is much larger than most people assume.  I wanted to start with the hip-hop base and take it from there.”\n\nElsewhere, Braille acknowledges his personal and artistic history on “Remember Your Path” and channels the energy of music icon James Brown on “Main Squeeze,” with whom Braille toured as an opening act during 2005 and 2006.  Then on “Calculated Risk” Braille gets personal by examining his decision to pursue and create lyric and beat-drive rap music with spiritual overtones.  It’s been a full time mission since 1999.  “This could really end up being really detrimental to my career.  I understand the risk of doing what I’ve done thus far.  I understand the risk that I might not make it, that people might not buy my records.  I understand those risks, but it’s still worth it to me to put everything into a making a record the way I want it to sound and not worry about what’s going on in the industry and on the radio.”  \n\nBraille was attracted to hip-hop at a young age.  Hearing the variety of different styles and artists that existed during the early- to mid-‘90s, Braille was inspired by the idea that he could write songs based on his own personal experiences and that he didn\'t have to fit into any specific stereotypes.  One group that was fundamental in Braille\'s development at the time was A Tribe Called Quest, who changed his outlook on music with its landmark 1993 album Midnight Marauders.  Rap was in the midst of a gangster rap renaissance at the time and the album’s uplifting, positive vibe gave the then teen-aged Braille a boost.   “Hearing people talk from different perspectives, I started to realize, ‘Hey, I could make music and still be myself,’” the Portland-raised rapper recalls today.  “It was fine that I grew up where I grew up.  My size, stature and my personality are all attributes.  They’re not negatives.  That’s just who I am, so I felt that if I embraced those things, then I could do whatever I wanted with it.”\n\nGrowing up, Braille had more to worry about than music.  Born in Portland, he and his family relocated to New Jersey when he was in high school.  During his stay on the east coast, his family went bankrupt and returned to Portland to live with Braille’s grandmother.  However, Braille enjoyed being close to Philadelphia and New York and decided to stay by himself on the East Coast.  In 1999, when he was 17, independent startup ESWP music released his first album, Lifefirst: Half The Battle.\n\nThe battle to survive proved too tough, so Braille moved back to Portland only to find out there was no room in the house for him.  He took a bus to Los Angeles in order to pursue a career in music.  After a year in LA, he went back to Oregon and met the woman that would eventually become his wife.  With music dreams, no high school diploma and newfound responsibility, Braille and his future wife started a business cleaning out repossessed homes.  \n\nThat wasn’t the work Braille wanted to do, so he and his wife moved out of their place, put their stuff in storage and lived out of their van while they toured around the United States doing concerts.  They didn’t ask for payment at shows.  With no bills, they sold merchandise to pay for gas and food.  “I didn\'t have many career options because I spent most of my teenage years working on music,” Braille says.  “That’s where I invested all of my time, so I was willing to make some sacrifices in order to continue pursuing it.”\n\nFortunately, the more Braille pursued his dream of making a living making music, the more real that dream became.  He buckled down and in 2004 released his second album, Shades of Grey.  The collection featured collaborations with 9th Wonder (Jay-Z, Destiny’s Child) and Rob Swift and laid the foundation for a successful career.  Thanks to such powerful, politically minded songs as “Keep On,” it was easy for URB magazine to tap Braille one of their “Next 100.”  \n\nThe following year, Braille’s newly formed label Hiphop IS Music released his third album, Box of Rhymes.  Following the album’s release he would experience the joy of becoming a father as well as the pain of loosing one.  The IV Edition deals with these issues and provides an outlook compromising of social change, spiritual beliefs, confidence and the ability to carry on.\n\nThough he did not grow up in a spiritual household, Braille found the spiritual references he encountered in rap encouraging and decided to act upon them.  “I believed there was something out there,” Braille says, “and I started out trying to be a positive person.  I felt a gut on my heart and I eventually ended up meeting this other artist, Trust One, and when we got together, I thought we were going to talk about hip-hop.  He told me more about God and I started on my path as a follower of Christ.  That had a big impact on the direction I took in life and as an artist\"\n\n3) No info about them, released a demo tape.\n\n4) Four Adult Males from Philadelphia. 90s-influenced hardcore punk with its own unique twist.

Epic is a Melodic Black Metal band from France - formed in 1996. They have released one demo and one full-length album.  After the release of their one and only full-length album they split up but, were cherished for their small releases pertaining to the evil ages of dark, old culture after the Roman era. \n\nThe bands over-all sound conveys a traditional Black Metal style similar to Satyricon and even have some Medieval touches in the synthesizers. The guitar and drums are very quiet and there are very few signs of much bass-like entities however, the synthesizers generally dominate the whole Atmosphere and feature occasional string, Symphonic verses. The vocals feature both clean, bitter evil sounds and common Black Metal vocals but, are increased in volume.\n\nEpic is from a suburban town in Paris called Créteil. Although, their styles have never moved in the direction of French culture, their lyrics may pertain potentially to the Catholic aspects followed in France. They have a hatred and historical captivation for the war of Christianity. Their album somewhat portrays the war of Christianity perishing on earth, which they feel leaves the world in better conditions. \n\nThe band generally has seven members and occasionally a cello player named Sir Meliador but, the main lineup includes; Emrys Evallach of Belostheme - Vocals, Lord Silmaeth - Lead Guitar, Lord Hyphares - Backup Guitar, Lady Morrigan\'n - Bass, Lord Korgan - Keyboards and Knight Hydraoth - Drums. All of the members have been in several well-known French Black Metal bands and others such as Mayhem. The band carried on their side-project work in the band called Love Lies Bleeding. \n\nIn March of 1997 the band released a small demo called \"Like a Swan Forever\". The demo contained four songs including an outro. One or two of them were featured in their only album. They were discovered by  Ancestral Craft Productions and in 1998 release \"Of Tears and Blood…\".\n\n2). Epic (Erin Patrick Carroll) is a Canadian underground hip-hop rapper. He has four releases on Clothes Horse Records.\n\nPossibly one of the most recognizable character in hip hop, Epic made underground hip hop heads take notice with his releases 8:30 in Newfoundland and Heater in My Truck. Epic\'s unorthodox flow and refreshing wit instigated a critical outpouring from the underground hip hop community. A capable, entertaining freestyler, he continues to hone his craft at public venues, community radio stations, parks, parties and parking lots.\n\nFor those who have downloaded (for free from clotheshorserecords.com!) his debut 8:30 In Newfoundland you’ll know that Epic is a general all-around champ. A Federal Government employee, former truck driver, student loan dodger, hockey fan, beer-sharer, bus-to-worker in search of a decent relationship and someone to beatbox for, Carroll will eat half of your Kraft Dinner and buy you a replacement box next paycheque. He became your best friend after one spin of 8:30, pretty much put Newfoundland on the hip hop map (although do go find Johnny Hardcore’s disc for a great Newf-rap listen), writes songs about corrupt Saskatchewan cops who leave First Nations Canadians to die in frozen prairie fields, and recounts the plight of the Walmart shopping-cart attendants who lost their jobs “for thoss eagulle automated 25 cent return” carts. Epic cares in an irresistibly charismatic, so-Canadian, wheatfield-metropolis way. That Gord Downie meets Jack Kerouac meets Henry Rollins kind of way.\n\nBut he rhymes like Fargo.\n\nThe drawl of the Dirty South, the Hotlanta Twang, the Staten Slur and even the T-dot Regg-Eh Chat have all met their match in the Prairie Peep. Carroll is a field mouse with a bullhorn, but as such he’s also the glaring exception to Guru’s “It’s Mostly The Voice” rule. Epic’s notably downhome perspective and subject matter lend an inexplicably airtight “hip hop” authenticity to his words despite the obvious Frances McDormand influence\n\n3). there\'s also a danish underground metal-core band called Epic.\n\n4).

Through God, Dewayne accepted salvation through Jesus Christ, and quickly realized God\'s will for his life. Dewayne had always had a talent with music and rapping, and so he soon quickly decided to use this gift as an outlet for evangelism. In 1998, Pettidee as an artist was born.

Making records, ceaseless concert tours, popularity, censorship and, finally, underground. \n\nIn details: \n\nIn 1991 “ZeCo” company put on the market the first album of the band “Let’s Talk about Sex” in cassettes and discs, the album became a hit. Because of vacuum in Russian audio market, because of arrangement novelty and originality, the first album was a success. That year there took places some changes: the company of Pavel Galkin, Mutabor, and Andrey Kotov, Den, was joined a new person Andrey Lysikov, Dolphin, who helped to formulate the conception of the band: epatage rap adapted to Russian audience. \n\nTrack “Sex Nonstop” is typical for the period. After it was shown on the first TV channel broke a scandal, as a result “50/50” station program editor was dismissed. That was the moment when problems began not only with TV, and with radio and press. In order to take part in TV show “Ploshchadka Muzoboza” (“Musical string ground”) Den, Dolphin and Mutabor urgently had to record a phonogram that could pass TV censorship, they had one night. It was track “Dances”. \n\nIn 1992 RDM company produced the first CD of the band called “Miss Big Breast” with such hits as “Breasts, Breasts”, “At the Last Time”, “Pornography”. It got difficult to find tickets for their concerts, it didn’t depend on the size of the concert ground. For instance in Moscow at the presentation of the new album the multi-purpose sport hall “Druzhba” couldn’t admit all the willing persons. They had to arrange extra concerts. And in Saint-Petersburg Ledovy Palace was crowded the whole week! \n\nAutumn 1994 saw the production of a new album “Kegli” (“Ninepins”). The conception of the band is basically the same, but texts grow ruder and the disks are marked “Obscene language”. Despite the rhythm and a kind of pops the changes strengthened the scandalous reputation of the band worsening relations with mass media hammering “Maltshishnik” in deeper underground. \n\nIn the same year developing a new album the musicians decided to disband the band as the project became rather cramped to bring to live their ideas. Dolphin took solo project using in his start album “Not in the focus” music of the latest unpublished works of “Maltshishnik”, Den and Mutabor opened a project of rude alternative electronic music called “Barbitura”. In 1996 – 2005 “Barbitura” produced seven albums, some live-shows gaining the popularity all over the country and abroad. \n\nSince 2000 the history of the band – “alive nostalgia” – continues but as a studio project. “Maltshishnik” in the initial form “Den – Mutabor” produse an album “Sandals” that is spread all over the CIS thanks to distribution company “Classic Company”. It was a blessing for the fans as the crazy inflammatory songs came back to them renewed and more interesting. The album attracted new fans as well. Meanwhile mass media go on boycotting the band. There are no new tracks of the band in any play-list of any radio and TV channel. The album is discussed only in Internet but in a very active way since the present and the past of the band attract all kinds of fans. \n\nIn 2002 a new album “Oglobla” (“Shaft”) was released. Great changes took place in the style of performance, arrangements and text composing. The quality of the product is evident. The album is magnificent. An unusual combination of vocal, texts and music can lead to the only conclusion: the guys are real professionals and the years of work bring their fruit. \n\nIn 2003 “Malchishnik” plays in public for the first time in almost ten year break. The concert was held at Ledovii Dvorec (the Ice Palace) in St. Petersburg with the “sold out” notice. Having sung their best songs, Dan and Mutabor confirmed once again their unique status at Russian stage and proved that the interest for the band decreased in the least, but on the contrary increased. As a result, the new album ensued to be much better, than “Best” released in 1999. \n\nIn 2004 there was a release of the album “Pena” (“The Foam”). The music on this record is much softer, than on previous ones, but nevertheless the number of appreciation increased in geometric series. The combination of humour and emotional lyrics with an excellent musical illustration makes the album easier for listening and understanding of a much wider auditory.',39519,448749),(736,'Контра Да Банда','',102,731),(737,'2nd Family','',1228,15153),(738,'Salvador Sanchez','',1114,9731),(739,'K-Drama','K-Drama, born Anthony Regis Jones, is a Christian rapper from Cincinnati, Ohio.

Foram 4 discos gravados, uma infinidade de shows, a mudança para o Rio de Janeiro e a confirmação de que estavam no caminho certo.\nO primeiro disco de Kleiton & Kledir foi lançado em 1980 e rapidamente a dupla se transformou num enorme sucesso. As rádios começaram a tocar suas músicas sem parar e o público lotava seus shows por todo país. Durante anos a história se repetiu. Foram 5 discos (mais 1 em espanhol) o que lhes rendeu disco de ouro e shows por USA, Europa e América Latina. Gravaram em Los Angeles, New York, Lisboa, Paris, Miami e Buenos Aires.

Também pelo mundo afora suas músicas ganharam versões de grandes artistas, como os argentinos Mercedes Sosa e Fito Paez e a cantora portuguesa Eugenia Mello e Castro.\n 	Kleiton & Kledir trouxeram definitivamente para a cultura popular brasileira a nova música gaúcha. Eternizaram um sotaque diferente e uma outra maneira de falar e cantar, com termos até então desconhecidos como “Deu pra ti”, “Tri legal”, etc. Esse jeito diferente de ser e fazer as coisas transformou K&K numa referência fundamental para quem quer entender a música brasileira do nosso tempo. Acabaram se transformando em símbolos do gaúcho contemporâneo, do homem moderno do sul do Brasil, o que fez com que o Governo do Estado lhes conferisse o título de “Embaixadores Culturais do Rio Grande do Sul”.\nMas apesar de tanto sucesso a dupla resolveu se separar. Kleiton foi viver na França, Kledir ficou no Rio. Gravaram discos solo, fizeram outros projetos e produções. Mas a saudade bateu e eles voltaram, depois de “umas férias de 7 anos”.

The videotape was distributed by Kim Loi Productions and turned out to be one of the bestselling overseas Vietnamese music videotapes of the year.\n\nAmong his most popular songs include Muoi Nam Yeu Em, Dan Ba, Muoi Nam Tinh Cu, Tinh Cho Khong (L\'amour C\'est Pour Rien), and Goi Ten Nguoi Quen (Aline). \n\nAfter surviving open heart surgery in 1998, Elvis Phuong and his second wife decided to move back to Vietnam.  He now makes his home in Ho Chi Minh City.  His first marriage tragically ended in the early 1970s when his wife was killed in an automobile accident in Saigon.  In the 1980s, he was in a long term relationship with Cat Phuong, film actress and principal dancer of the legendary Luu Hong Dance Troupe which performed at Maxim\'s back in Saigon prior to 1975.  On May 10, 2014, he celebrated his 54th year in show business in a sold out live concert show held at Lan Anh Music Venue in Ho Chi Minh City.  Among the featured guest performers that night included Dam Vinh Hung, Duong Trieu Vu, Pham Anh Khoa, Le Hieu and Nguyen Anh 9.  Elvis Phuong has a younger sister, Kieu Nga, and a son from his first marriage, Phuong Hung, who are both established overseas Vietnamese singers. \n\nElvis Phương, real name Phạm Ngọc Phương (born Thủ Dầu Một 1945) is a Vietnamese popular singer. To the Vietnamese-American community, and to many other Vietnamese all over the world, he is our own male superstar of the Vietnamese music industry.\n\nLoved music since he was 6 years of age, Elvis learned to sing by listening to the records or tapes of foreign singers, especially Elvis Presley. When he was 17 or 18 years old, against his father wishes, Elvis Phuong chose to stay in Viet Nam to pursue a career in singing instead of going to France for an education. Elvis Phuong, whose real name is Pham Ngoc Phuong selected his stage name after his idol, Elvis Presley.\n\nHis first appearance in front of an audience was in 1962 at Regina Pacis high school\'s open house where he sang Nua dem ngoai pho and O\' Cangaceiro. The first band that he worked with was the Rockin\' Stars, a popular band during the early 60s. In subsequent years, he also collaborated with other famous bands such as Les Vampires and Phuong Hoang. In 1968, Mr Ngoc Chanh of Shotguns Productions produced Elvis Phuong\'s first album titled Shotguns 26: Tieng Hat Elvis Phuong. In 1977, Elvis Phuong\'s musical journey took him by storm with the first album produced overseas titled Hat Cho Nguoi Vuot Bien. Since then, Elvis Phuong has recorded many tapes and/or CDs and appeared in many videos.\n\nElvis Phuong is a strong and surprisingly versatile singer. He covers a wide range of styles such as Rock n\' Roll, Pop, Folk, Pre-War, Post-War, Ballad etc. His name is associated with hits such as Vet Thu Tren Lung Ngua Hoang, Ao Em Sut Chi Duong Ta, Dan Ba, Dem Nho Ve SaiGon etc.\n\nAs described in a press release, his latest work Ta On Doi - Ta On Nguoi was made in Viet Nam to portray his 35 years career as a singer. His diversified talent is manifested on this video, a collection of gems that were displayed through the lyrical and musical terrain of Rock\'n\'Roll (Blue Suede Shoes), Folks (Tat Nuoc Dau Dinh, Qua Cau Gio Bay), and Romantic Ballads - in Vietnamese, English and French (Thuong Nhau Ngay Mua, Giot Nang Ben Them, Unchained Melody, Aline, Ma Vie etc.). All of the songs were skillfully mixed by either Manh Trinh or Billy Shane or Chi Tai or Bill Kilpatrick except for one, \"Yeu Nguoi Va Yeu Doi.\" Here, the listeners witness Elvis Phuong\'s talent, and without any high tech or fancy mixing, just his powerful and filled with emotion tone of voice, accompanied by the guitar of Le Huu Ha.\n\nElvis Phuong, says, \"I chose the name of the video Ta On Doi - Ta On Nguoi to show my appreciation of what I have today. I would not be where I am today without the love and support of my colleagues and my fans.\" Elvis Phuong, his wife, Phan Le Hoa and the crew from Kim Loi Productions, traveled throughout the North, Central and South Viet Nam to locate the appropriate scenes for this video.\n\nLiving for Elvis Phuong means knowing to enjoy life to the fullest. His secrets to a happy marriage are trust, love, honesty, and loyalty. Elvis Phuong and his wife, Phan Le Hoa, established their own company, EP Productions in Cerritos, Southern California.

Aside from his work with his own material, Charry has also composed music for various small budget films, commercials, and theater productions. \n\nCharry is a former member of \"Oui Oui,\" a French pop group formed in 1983. Guitarist/singer Étienne Charry and drummer Michel Gondry met at secondary school in Sèvres in 1978. The repertoire of songs Oui Oui built up was a reaction to what was termed cold wave music in France and the more politicised rock groups of the era. Numerous musicians passed through the group\'s ranks in the early years. With the addition of keyboardist Gilles Chapat and bassist Nicolas Dufournet, a more settled line-up was established.\n\nIn 1989 Oui Oui released their first album Chacun Tout Le Monde on the Just\'in label. Following the departure of Gilles Chapat, the second Oui Oui album Formidable (1991, released by FNAC Music) was recorded by the trio of Charry, Gondry and Dufournet.

He organised the traveling group and in October 1971 they departed on their tour. The group travelled around New Zealand in a very distinctive red bus.\n\nThe group lived in a commune for many years. Three families, including Bruno Lawrence\'s and Geoff Murphy\'s, lived together. The group came to the attention of those in the New Zealand film industry and were at times employed to create work for TVNZ. The group were labeled as hippies during this time and were looked down upon by some in the industry despite the quality and nature of their work.\n\nThroughout the years that Blerta traveled the line up changed, over time members included Lawrence, Fane Flaws, Beaver, Geoff Murphy, Tony Barry, Mick Liber as well as many others, of which some had previously worked with Bruno in bands and others joined along the way. The original line up was Bruno Lawrence, Corben Simpson, Kemp Turirangi, Geoff Murphy, Alan Moon, Tony Littlejohn, Beaver, Eric Foley and Chris Seresin.

She is also Shayla\'s mom. In 1979, Thanh Tuyền\'s family came to the United States and settled in Washington and then Houston, Texas.\n\nAs a child, Thanh Tuyền demonstrated a nack for singing and performance. At the age of five, against the wishes of her parents, she studied music with an uncle. Consequently, she was often disciplined for being so defiant. She later studied music under Mr. Mạnh Phát. She first sang publicly at Thông Nhất Theater in Saigon at the age of 7. She received many praises for this performance and the newspapers at the time gave her the title, \"Như Mai The Prodigy\". In her words, \"I only wanted to have a voice like the sound of a stream to bathe the masses\". Thanh Tuyền also plays the guitar, dances, acts, and sings Vọng cổ.\n\nIn 1964, after signing an exclusive contract with Continental studio, she recorded the hit Chiều Mưa Biên Giới by Mr. Nguyễn Văn Đông. Almost overnight, Thanh Tuyền became a household name. That same year, she received recording awards from South Vietnam\'s recording industry.\n\nWhen asked about her source of influence, Thanh Tuyền states that she really does not model after any artist or style. In fact, she just sings the way she feels. She claims that when she performs, the music and her emotions become one. Although she added that she does choose her music carefully to meet the demand of her audience.\n\nAfter 30 years in show business, Thanh Tuyền has countless stories from her years on the road singing to entertain the troops, singing at night clubs, on stages from central to south Vietnam, as well as in various parts of the United States and the world. She added that \"each of the performances brings back a special memory that is forever inscribed in her heart, and that she feels the love in her audience on each of those occasions\".

Domengeaux was killed in a motorcycle accident in southwestern Louisiana.\n\nAlthough the band plays primarily Cajun music, other forms are blended into the music. The mood of the Bayou Ruler album (produced by C. C. Adcock and Tarka Cordell) is a bit edgier than its other albums. This emotional quality seems to reveal a level of comfort with the music that far surpassed the bands other albums.\n\nOn their latest album Dominos they have two excellent medleys \"Napoleon B.

Their timing seems quite precise and allows the band to do interesting effects such as they do when they overlay parts on the fiddle on the song \"Creole Stomp\" on the Happy Town album.\n\nThe addition of Sam Broussard on guitar five years ago added an extra dimension to their music. Steve has his own blend of precision and speed on the accordion which sets him apart from many Cajun accordion players. David Greely the fiddle player finds old songs and poems and brings them to life. The vocal harmonies the Mamou Playboys do allows them to bring a new audience to traditional songs. Cajun music and Cajun dancing go hand and hand. They play a mixture of song types that are good for doing different kinds of dances. Some of the dances that suit their songs are waltz, cajun jig, swing, slow dance, two steps, and zydeco.

Manmohan Waris is one of the top Punjabi singers in the world. He has been around for almost 12 years now. Since he released his first album \"Gairan Naal Peenghan Jhootdeye\' in 1993, he has never looked back. Punjabis around the world love him and he feels the pressure of not letting them down. His humbleness and sincerity has won many hearts. His voice is considered one of the sweetest around and his songs attest to his passion for clean and literary lyrics. So far Waris has released 17 albums which are:\n\n      1.  Gairan Naal Peenghan Jhootdeye\n      2.  Sohnian De Laaray\n      3.  Hasdi De Ful Kirde\n      4.  Sajjre Challe Muklavay\n      5.

He had a great interest in music since an early age. He started his formal music training at the age of 11. Everything he learned from his Guru, he taught his younger brothers. So all three brothers got seriously involved in music at a very early age.\n\nHe got his music degree from Punjab University. But the most influential music Guru he had was Shree Jaswant Singh Bhanwra. Unlike many other Punjabi singers who also learned music from Shree Jaswant Singh Bhnawra, the Guru did not teach him so called \"Lok-Gaayiki\", he insisted on teaching him the real music he knew himself. He saw a great singer in Manmohan and he wanted him to shine.\n\nIn 1990, Manmohan Waris\'s family moved to Canada. Here he made his first album \'Gairan Naal Peenghan Jhootdeye.\' The album was a great success and when Waris returned to Punjab, Punjabi\'s everywhere just couldn\'t get enough of him. So he decided to move back to India.\n\nHis career has never seen a foggy day since that time. Waris\' philosophy about his name and fame may have something to do with that. In his opinion \"keeping your name on the top is not an easy thing, you have to work hard to get here, and you have to work harder to stay here\".\n\nManmohan got married in 1996 and in 1997 he and his wife Pritpal had their first baby. It was a boy and they named him \'Amar\' after the great Punjabi Dhadi singer \'Amar Singh Shaunki. Manmohan\'s in-laws are also from the same village as the late Dhadi. Waris has recorded a few of Dhadi Amar Singh Shaunki\'s songs as a tribute to him. These songs are:\n\n      1. Do Tara Vajda Ve (1993)\n      2. Aja Bhabi Jhoot Le (2000)\n      3. Ghar Hun Kitni Ku Doore (2003)\n\n             Manmohan\'s latest religious release, named “Tasveer” contains 9 very touching and thoughtful songs. In 2001 Manmohan and his wife had their second child, a girl named \'Saiya\'. Manmohan spends most of the year in Punjab and he tours the west in the summer.\n\n                               Manmohan\'s songs are evergreen songs. People remember his earliest work same way as they do his latest. Manmohan\'s  latest Punjabi Album is titled \"Nachiye Majajne\". The album is on Plasma Records/Kiss records and got a great response from Punjabis everywhere. The title song \"Aja Appan Nachiye Majajne\" with its Desi music and Dhole rhythms is a milestone on the future path of Punjabi music. Also the success of \'Punjabi Virsa.\' another song from this album proves that there is still room for literary and meaningful poetry in the fast paced, single based commercial Punjabi music world.\n\nWaris has always worked hard to put his efforts where his heart is. He is always eager to point out anything that gets his attention. He has never sung a song to gain mere a commercial success. But this is not his greatness, his greatness is that he doesn\'t do it to serve his language or his native land, he just does it because he is that kind of person and it is his nature.\n\nWe hope that Waris will continue to give us thoughtful and yet entertaining music for many years to come and may God help him to live his dreams.\nSwaran Shergill @ punjaab.com',5267,40965),(809,'Sai Saing Maw','',564,5556),(810,'HARBHAJAN SHERA','',359,2092),(811,'Fumiya Fujii','藤井フミヤ',5859,40968),(812,'Fábio Jr.','Nome: Flávio Airosa Correia Galvão\nNascimento: 21/11/1953\nOrigem: São Paulo / São Paulo - Brazil\n\nFábio Ariosa Correia Galvão nasceu em São Paulo no ano de 1953.

He scored for the films Zorba the Greek (1964), Z (1969), and Serpico (1973). He is viewed as Greece\'s best-known living composer.\n\nPolitically, he identified with the left until the late 1980s; in 1989 he ran as an independent candidate within the centre-right New Democracy party in order for the country to come out of the political crisis that had been created due to the numerous scandals of the government of Andreas Papandreou and helped to establish a large coalition between conservatives, socialists and leftists. In 1990 he was elected to the parliament (as in 1964 and 1981), became a government minister under Constantine Mitsotakis, and fought against drugs and terrorism and for culture, education and better relations between Greece and Turkey. He continues to speak out in favor of left-liberal causes, Greek-Turkish-Cypriot relations, and against the War in Iraq. He has consistently opposed oppressive regimes and was a key voice against the Greek junta 1967-1974, which imprisoned him.\n\nBiography\nEarly years\nMikis Theodorakis was born on the Greek island of Chios and spent his childhood years in different provincial Greek cities such as Mytilene, Cephallonia, Patras, Pyrgos, and Tripoli. His father, a lawyer and a civil servant, was from the small village of Kato Galatas, in Crete and his mother, Aspasia Poulakis, was from an ethnically Greek family in Çeşme, in what is today Turkey. He was raised with Greek folk music and was influenced by Byzantine liturgy; as a child he had already talked about becoming a composer. Theodorakis\'s fascination with music began in early childhood; he taught himself to write his first songs without access to musical instruments. In Patras and Pyrgos he took his first music lessons, and in Tripoli, Peloponnese, he gave his first concert at the age of seventeen.\n\nHe went to Athens in 1943, and became a member of a Reserve Unit of ELAS, and led a troop in the fight against the British and the Greek right in the Dekemvriana. During the Greek Civil War he was arrested, sent into exile on the island of Icaria and then deported to the island of Makronisos, where he was tortured and twice buried alive.\n\nDuring the periods when he was not obliged to hide, not exiled or jailed, he studied from 1943 to 1950 at the Athens Conservatoire under Filoktitis Economidis. In 1950, he finished his studies and took his last two exams \"with flying colours\". He went to Crete, where he became the \"head of the Chania Music School\" and founded his first orchestra. At this time he ended what he has called the first period of his musical writing.\n\nStudies in Paris\nIn 1954 he travelled with his young wife Myrto Altinoglou to Paris where he entered the Conservatory and studied musical analysis under Olivier Messiaen and conducting under Eugene Bigot. His time in Paris, 1954–1959, was his second period of musical writing.\n\nHis symphonic works: a Piano concerto, his first suite, his first symphony, and his scores for the ballet: Greek Carnival, Le Feu aux Poudres, Les Amants de Teruel, received international acclaim. In 1957, he won the Gold Medal in the Moscow Music Festival; President of the Jury was Dmitri Shostakovitch. In 1959, after the successful performances of Theodorakis\'s ballet Antigone at Covent Garden in London, the French composer Darius Milhaud proposed him for the American Copley Music Prize - an award of the \"William and Noma Copley Foundation\", which later changed its name to \"Cassandra Foundation\" - as the \"Best European Composer of the Year\". His first international scores for the film Ill Met by Moonlight and Luna de Miel, directors: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, were also very successful: The Honeymoon title song became part of the repertoire of The Beatles.\n\nNotable works up to 1960\nChamber Music: Four String Quartets; Trio four piano, violin, cello; Little Suite for piano; Sonatina for piano; Sonatinas No.1 and No.2 for violin and piano;\nSymphonic music: Assi-Gonia (symphonic movement; Piano Concerto \"Helicon\"; Symphony No.1 (Proti Simfonia); Suites n° 1, 2 et 3 for orchestre; La Vie et la Mort / Live and Death (for voice and strings); Œdipus Tyrannos (for strings; later for quartet and symphony orchestra); Piano Concerto;\nBallets: Greek Carnival; Le Feu aux Poudres; Les Amants de Teruel; Antigone;\nFilmscores: The Barefoot Battalion (Greg Tallas); Ill Met by Moonlight and Honeymoon (Powell and Pressburger); Faces in the Dark (David Eady).\n\nBack to Greek roots\n\nMikis Theodorakis shortly after his return to Greece, 1961,with Nicholas G. Constantin, Athanasios G. Konstantinopoulos, and Bill Vanech on his right, in his club called MYRTIA\nIn 1960, Theodorakis returned to Greece and his roots in genuine Greek music: With his song cycle Epitaphios he started the third period of his composing and contributed to a cultural revolution in his country.[41] His most significant and influential works are based Greek and world poetry – Epiphania (Giorgos Seferis), Little Kyklades (Odysseas Elytis), Axion Esti (Odysseas Elytis), Mauthausen (Iakovos Kambanellis), Romiossini (Yannis Ritsos), and Romancero Gitano (Federico García Lorca) – he attempted to give back to Greek music a dignity which in his perception it had lost. He developed his concept of \"metasymphonic music\" (symphonic compositions that go beyond the \"classical\" status and mix symphonic elements with popular songs, Western symphonic orchestra and Greek popular instruments).\n\nHe founded the Little Orchestra of Athens and the Musical Society of Piraeus, gave many, many concerts all around Greece and abroad... and he naturally became involved in the politics of his home country. After the assassination of Gregoris Lambrakis in May 1963 he founded the Lambrakis Democratic Youth (\"Lambrakidès\") and was elected its president. Under Theodorakis\'s impetus, it started a vast cultural renaissance movement and became the greatest political organisation in Greece with more than 50.000 members.[43] Following the 1964 elections, Theodorakis became a member of the Greek Parliament, associated with the left-wing party EDA. Because of his political ideas, the composer was black-listed by the cultural establishment; at the time of his biggest artistic glory, a large number of his songs were censored-before-studio or were not allowed on the radio stations.\n\nDuring 1964, he wrote the music for the Michael Cacoyiannis film Zorba the Greek, whose main theme, since then, exists as a trademark for Greece. It is also known as \'Syrtaki dance\'; inspired from old Cretan traditional dances.\n\nMain works of this period\nSong cycles: Epitaphios (Yannis Ritsos); Archipelagos (Songs of the Islands), Politia A & B (Songs of the City), Epiphania (Giorgos Seferis, Nobel Prize 1963), Mikres Kyklades (Odysseas Elytis), Chrysoprasino Fyllo (Golden-green leaf), Mauthausen (Iakovos Kambanellis), Romiossini (Yannis Ritsos), Thalassina Feggaria (Moons of the Sea)\nOratorio: To Axion Esti[45] (Odysseas Elytis, Nobel Prize 1979), cf.

Theodorakis (1971)\nOn 21 April 1967 a right wing junta (the Regime of the Colonels) took power in a putsch. Theodorakis went underground and founded the \"Patriotic Front\" (PAM). On 1 June, the Colonels published \"Army decree No 13\", which banned playing, and even listening to his music. Theodorakis himself was arrested on 21 August,[47] and jailed for five months. Following his release end of January 1968, he was banished in August to Zatouna with his wife Myrto and their two children, Margarita and Yorgos.[48] Later he was interned in the concentration camp of Oropos.[49] An international solidarity movement, headed by such personalities as Dmitri Shostakovich, Leonard Bernstein, Arthur Miller, and Harry Belafonte demanded to get Theodorakis freed. On request of the French politician Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, Theodorakis was allowed to go into exile to Paris on 13 April 1970. Theodorakis\'s flight left very secretly from an Onassis owned private airport outside Athens. Theodorakis arrived at Le Bourget Airport where he met Costa Gavras, Melina Mercouri and Jules Dassin. Theodorakis was immediately hospitalized because he suffered from lung tuberculosis.[50] Myrto Theodorakis, Mikis\'s wife and two children joined him a week later in France. They arrived from Greece to France via Italy on a boat.\n\nMain works under the dictatorship\nSong cycles: Ta Laïka (The Popular Songs, Manos Elefteriou);[52] O Ilios ke o Chronos (Sun and Time, Theodorakis); Songs for Andreas (Theodorakis); Arcadies I-X; Nichta Thanatou (Nights of Death, Manos Elefteriou);\nOratorios: Ephiphania Averoff Giorgos Seferis, State of Siege (Marina = Rena Hadjidakis), March of the Spirit (Angelos Sikelianos), Raven (Giorgos Seferis, after Edgar Allan Poe);\nFilm score: Z (Costa-Gavras).\n\nResistance in exile\nWhile in exile, Theodorakis fought during four years for the overthrow of the colonels. He started his world tours and gave thousands of concerts on all continents as part of his struggle for the restoration of democracy in Greece.\n\nMikis Theodorakis at a concert in Caesarea, Israel, in the 1970s.\nHe met Pablo Neruda and Salvador Allende and promised them to compose his version of Neruda\'s Canto General. He was received by Gamal Abdel Nasser and Tito, Yigal Allon and Yasser Arafat, while François Mitterrand,[53] Olof Palme and Willy Brandt became his friends. For millions of people, Theodorakis was the symbol of resistance against the Greek dictatorship.\n\nMain works written in exile\n1.

In 1978, through his article For a United Left Wing, he had \"stirred up the Greek political life. His proposal for the unification of the three parties of the former United Left – which had grown out of the National Liberation Front (N.L.F.) – had been accepted by the Greek Communist Party which later proposed him as the candidate for mayor of Athens during the 1978 elections.\" (Andreas Brandes) He was later elected several times to the Greek Parliament (1981–1986 and 1989–1993) and for two years, from 1990 to 1992, he was a minister in the government of Constantine Mitsotakis. After his resignation as a member of Greek parliament, he was appointed General Musical Director of the Choir and the two Orchestras of the Hellenic State Radio (ERT), which he reorganised and with which he undertook successful concert tours abroad.\n\nHe is committed to heightening international awareness of human rights, of environmental issues, and of the need for peace and for this reason he initiated, together with the Turkish author, musician, singer, and filmmaker Zülfü Livaneli the Greek–Turkish Friendship Society.\n\nFrom 1981, Theodorakis had started the fourth period of his musical writing, during which he returned to the symphonic music, while still going on to compose song-cycles. His most significant works written in these years are his Second, Third, Fourth and Seventh Symphony, most of them being first performed in the former German Democratic Republic between 1982 and 1989. It was during this period that he received the Lenin Peace Prize. He composed his first opera Kostas Kariotakis (The Metamorphoses of Dionysus) and the ballet Zorba the Greek, premièred in the Arena of Verona during the Festival Verona 1988. During this period, he also wrote the five volumes of his autobiography: The Ways of the Archangel (Οι δρόμοι του αρχάγγελου).\n\nIn 1989, he started the fifth period, the last, of his musical writing: He composed three operas (lyric tragedies) Medea, first performed in Bilbao (1 October 1991), Elektra, first performed in Luxembourg (2 May 1995) and Antigone, first performed in Athens\' Megaron Moussikis (7 October 1999). This trilogy was complemented by his last opera Lysistrata, first performed in Athens (14 April 2002): a call for peace... With his operas, and with his song cycles from 1974 to 2006, Theodorakis ushered in the period of his Lyrical Life.\n\nFor a period of 10 years, Alexia Vassiliou teamed up with Mikis Theodorakis and his Popular Orchestra. During that time, and as a tribute to Theodorakis’s body of work, Vassiliou recorded a double album showcasing some of the composer’s most consummate musical creations, and in 1998, Sony BMG released the album entitled Alexia–Mikis Theodorakis.\n\nTheodorakis is Doctor honoris causa of several universities, including Montreal, Thessaloniki, and Crete.\n\nTheodorakis holding hands with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou\nNow he lives in retirement, reading, writing, publishing arrangements of his scores, texts about culture and politics.

The main goal of \"Spitha\" is to help Greece stay clear of its economic crisis.[65] On 31 May Mikis Theodorakis gave a speech attended by appropximately 10,000 Greeks in the center of Athens, criticising the Greek government for the loan debt it has taken from the International Monetary Fund.[66] It was also the first time in many decades that he called for revolution.[citation needed]\n\nWork\nSongs and song cycles\nTheodorakis has written more than 1,000 songs and song-cycles, whose melodies have become part of the heritage of Greek music: Sto Perigiali, Kaimos, Aprilis, Doxa to Theo, Sotiris Petroulas, Lipotaktes, Stis Nichtas to Balkoni, Agapi mou, Pou petaxe t\'agori mou, Anixe ligo to parathiro, O Ipnos se tilixe, To gelasto pedi, Dendro to dendro, Asma Asmaton, O Andonis...\n\nHis song cycles are based on poems by Greek authors, as well as by Lorca and Neruda: Epitaphios, Archipelagos, Politia A-D, Epiphania, The Hostage, Mykres Kyklades, Mauthausen, Romiossini, Sun and Time, Songs for Andreas, Mythology, Night of Death, Ta Lyrika, The Quarters of the World, Dionysos, Phaedra, Mia Thalassa, Os Archaios Anemos, Ta Lyrikotera, Ta Lyrikotata, Erimia, Odysseia.

He won audiences with his great vocal talent and good sense of humour. He was one of four contestants (Nera Stipičević, Natalie Dizdar and winner Rafael Dropulić) to compete for the grand prize in the last show. After the show, due to contractual obligations, he performed in Saša, Tin i Kedžo boy band. Since jazz music happened to be his personal preference, he was very un-enthusiastic about the whole project. After band collapsed in 2004 he continued with solo career .\n\nIn August 2005 he married his long-time girlfriend Marija Bajs. In 2007 he recorded his, old-school soul sounding, debut album named \'1 dan\', where he continues to show his impressive vocal skills through 10 carefully chosen songs.',1071,7765),(838,'Mannakorn','',3154,58662),(839,'Eduard Khil','Eduard Khil (Eduard Anatolyevich Khil, or Эдуа́рд Анато́льевич Хиль in Russian, September 4, 1934 – June 4, 2012) was a Russian baritone, well known in his country from his singing in the 1960s and later. He fell into obscurity with the fall of the Soviet Union. He is best known in the Anglosphere for his 1976 hit transliterated into English as \"I am very glad, because I\'m finally returning back home\" (often called \"Trololo\", \"Trolololo\", \"Trololololo\", or similar names) due to internet attention.',37336,217979),(840,'Tsai Chin','Tsai Chin (Chinese: 蔡琴; pinyin: Cài Qín; Minnan: Chhoà Khîm) is a pop and folk singer from Taiwan (her ancestral home is in Hubei). She sings in both Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese (Min Nan) and is known for her naturally magnetic rich vocals and witty persona. Her well-known hits include 《被遗忘的时光》、《恰似你的温柔》、《最后一夜》、《读你》、《你的眼神》 and more. The peak of her popularity in Taiwan was from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s but she remains popular in mainland China.\n\nTaiwan songstress Tsai Chin is an unquestionably enduring force on the music scene, after achieving her earliest hits in the late 70s, scoring unparalleled fame in the 80s, and having her voice dominate much of the Chinese radio airwaves throughout the 80s and a good half of the 90s. \n\nEvene today, at the age of 49, Tsai Chin is never quite out of sight of her fans with all her ongoing concerts and musicals. Today, Our reporter Xiaohua reveals the amazing career of music legend Tsai Chin.\n\nIt\'s not easy to describe just how popular Tsai Chin has been with mere words, so perhaps the best proof comes from a classic scene in the Hong Kong movie \"The Infernal Affairs \", in which two opponents meet in a music shop and sit down shoulder to shoulder to appreciate the songs of Tsai Chin. One of the two makes a comment something like this: \"Her soprano tenor is sweet, while the alto is accurate, and the contralto bass is deep. In a word, it\'s transparent.\" This sums up the opinions of most fans really well. Her thick, natural, magnetic voice and captivating persona give Tsai Chin enduring charm. \n\nThe track you\'ve been listening to is one of Tsai Chin\'s older hits called \"The Forgotten Time\". The song features Tsai Chin singing solo, her comfortable mezzo-soprano vocals featured, with barely any musical accompaniment at the opening. As its name suggests, the song aims to call back deeply buried memories within people\'s hearts, be they sweet or bitter. Tsai Chin\'s voice evokes soft melodies and deep emotions, already enough to ripple the serene surface of ones soul like a gentle breeze, even without the help of lyrics.\n\nTsai Chin\'s legend began with a singing competition during her first year in college. At that time, singing Taiwan school ballads with a guitar was very popular. Through that competition, she found her favorite guitar and started on her successful music career. She reached her prime in the 80s, picking up numerous music awards from Taiwan and Hong Kong touring across Asia, Europe and the USA. Tsai has released 41 albums all told and is widely popular throughout the Chinese world. One saying goes \"Wherever there are Chinese, you will find Tsai Chin.\" \n\n\"Just like Your Tenderness\" is the song that won Tsai Chin thundering fame in 1980. It was composed by late Taiwan musician, Liang Hongzhi, who passed away twenty years after writing the legendary hit. After all her ups and downs, Tsai has now really achieved a better understanding of the song: \n\n\"Actually, it\'s not a melancholy song. What it tells of is a kind of loneliness. Now after I\'ve gone through many ups and downs in life, I understand the loneliness of the composer even better. Imagine his loneliness. He compares himself to an isolated island with no one around, where only the tender hand of the waves brings him comfort.\" \n\nNow with that explanation in mind, let\'s have a listen to this ever popular number, which is still the most requested song wherever Tsai Chin appears. \n\nAlthough she\'s had a singing career spanning almost three decades, she\'s still not perceived as being out of date. She grows with time the way wine gets better with age---and she\'s forever the favorite of music aficionados. Now after going through all the joys and sorrows of life, Tsai Chin\'s songs seem to have an even richer emotional quality. The warmth in her songs aims directly at the very soft corners of the heart, making a direct hit. The last song we\'re going to play for you is entitled \"Ferry Crossing\". The intensely poetic lyrics, written by famous Taiwan poet Xi Murong, go like this: \"Let us shake hands one last time, then I will withdraw my hand. There\'s not even a wild flower at the ferry crossing to give as a parting gift, so that we can only stare at each other. Take my blessings on the front of your gown. Tomorrow you\'ll be at the other end of the world.\" The song is a beautiful showcase of Tsai Chin\'s full-throated and rich voice, filled with nuance and emotion.\n\nTrivia\nIn one scene of the 2002 hit Hong Kong thriller movie Infernal Affairs, two rivals meet in a music shop and sit to appreciate the music of Tsai Chin.\n\nShe was once married to Taiwanese Director Edward Yang.',17402,195309),(841,'Gretchen','Maria Odete Brito de Miranda de Souza (born May 29, 1959), known professionally as Gretchen, is a Brazilian singer, dancer and businesswoman.

She has a son, Nick Xidi, who is also a songwriter and producer of Greek music.',22013,160512),(843,'Duy Khánh','Duy Khánh (1936 - 2003) was one of the most prolific songwriters and singers of traditional folk music in South Vietnam prior to 1975.  Among his most popular compositions included Ai Ra Xứ Huế, Lối Về Đất Mẹ, Thương Về Miền Trung and Xin Anh Giữ Trọn Tình Quê.\n\nDuy Khánh moved to the United States in 1988.  He would continue his career as a performer for the overseas community there and also set up a vocals instructional class with legendary Vietnamese songstress, Thái Thanh.  During the 1990s up until the year before his death, Duy Khánh had made several memorable appearances on the live show music video series produced by Asia Entertainment performing songs such as Xin Anh Giữ Trọn Tình Quê, Xuân Này Con Không Về written by Trịnh Lâm Ngân, Người Lính Gìa Xa Quê Nhà written by Nhật Ngân and a pair of medleys combining tunes written by Trúc Phương and himself together with Thanh Thúy, Hoàng Oanh and Phương Hồng Quê.\n\nOn February 12, 2003, Duy Khánh passed away at the age of 66 in Fountain Valley, California.

He sang in Azerbaijani, Russian, Persian, Turkish, Hindi, Urdu and Bengali among other languages.\nHe became popular when he played the lead role of Askar, the wealthy peddler, in a movie Arshin Mal Alan (“The Cloth Peddler”) which was based on a 1913 musical comedy by Uzeyir Hajibeyov.\nRashid’s father, Majid Behbudlu was a well-known singer too. \n\nHe toured and performed concerts in several countries including: the United Kingdom, Finland, Iran, Turkey, China, Albania, Bulgaria, Belgium, Ethiopia, India, Iraq, Chile, Argentina. \n\nIn Azerbaijan, the name Rashid Behbudov is automatically linked to the history of Azeri popular music. His vocal masterpieces range from proud hymns devoted to the beauty of the Motherland to tender, lyrical confessions of love.\nHe is especially remembered for his portrayal of Askar, the rich, merchant in search of love in the 1945 movie version of Uzeyir Hajibeyov’s music comedy, “Arshin Mal Alan.” Rashid Behbudov’s rare talent did not develop overnight. However, once he was discovered, his fame spread like wild fire, and he toured tirelessly, giving concerts one after another all over the world. Even though travel for those who lived behind the “Iron Curtain” was generally restricted, exceptions were made for Rashid.',5850,65990),(847,'The Silos','In 1985, when vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Walter Salas-Humara recorded a handful of tunes with the help of a dozen and a half friends and collected the songs under the title About Her Steps, he probably wasn\'t thinking that it was the start of a career in music that\'s now approaching 20 years and still going strong. No, at that point, he was too busy thinking about, among other things, names. \"In the beginning, I didn\'t want to use my name because I thought it was too hard for people to deal with,\" explains Salas-Humara when discussing the origin of the Silos name. \"So I came up with a name that was two syllables, easy to roll of the tongue, and works in all languages more or less.\"\n\nWith a name in hand, as well as some (in his words) \"unexpected interest\" in About Her Steps, Salas-Humara put together a touring band. That line-up made Cuba, originally released in 1987, an exhilarating album that introduced the Silos\' enviable ability to communicate effectively in both a whisper and a howl. Cuba attracted national attention. The video for \"Tennessee Fire\" was played by MTV and the band was voted \"Best New American Band\" by the Rolling Stone critic\'s poll. The band subsequently signed to RCA Records and the third album under the Silos name (self-titled, but often conveniently referred to as The One With The Bird On The Cover) was even better and led to an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. Its spacious, organic quality made it seem out of place in 1990; however, looking back at the album from within the Alternative-Indy glow of the decade\'s end, The Silos resonates like the work of visionaries.\n\nSince that landmark album, Salas-Humara has kept the Silos name alive with a continuing series of impassioned recordings and miles and miles of roadwork. Four Silos studio albums, Hasta La Victoria (1992) and Susan Across The Ocean (1994), Heater (1998). Laser Beam Next Door (2001), and When The Telephone Rings (2004) followed. The latest album, Come On Like The Fast Lane, is their most accomplished to date, mixing primitive rock, edgy psychedelia and down-home organic soul without reservation. Salas-Humara has also released several solo albums, produced several others for such kindred spirits as Michael Hall and Jim Roll, was a founding member of the seminal soul/drone band The Vulgar Boatmen, did some guest drumming on Hazeldine\'s Orphans, and joined Hall and Alejandro Escovedo in a two-off named The Setters. Ira Robbins, writing in The Trouser Press Record Guide, describes Salas-Humara as an \"unflashy auteur whose alt-rock amalgam drapes country, punk, baroque stateliness and pop in an abiding sadness.\" When you look at Salas-Humara\'s wide-ranging career and his dedication to the art of songwriting, it\'s definitely not a stretch to include his name alongside the likes of Escovedo, REM, Lucinda Williams, Stephen Malkmus, and Neil Young.\n\nThese days, Salas-Humara is enjoying the stability of a Silos line-up that\'s been together longer than any other, closing in on nine years, with Drew Glackin on bass and lap steel and Konrad Meissner on drums. \"We all enjoy each other\'s company quite a bit\" is Salas-Humara\'s take on this longevity. \"And stylistically, it all locks together in an interesting way. Visceral guitar playing combined with very melodic bass work and eclectic drumming works in a trio format. And to have the steel guitar (courtesy of Glackin) on the quieter songs adds a whole other dimension.\"\n\nThe Silos create a sound that\'s hard to pin down. According to Buzz McClain in The Washington Post, the band creates \"powerful earthy pop that sounds like the result of Nirvana riding on R.E.M.\'s tour bus.\" \"The band\'s austere style inflects the astringent twang of The Velvet Underground with the drone of R.E.M. and adds countryish echoes that recall Gram Parsons,\" offered Stephen Holden in The New York Times. \"We get compared to everybody,\" says Salas-Humara. \"To some people, we\'re a country band. To other people, we\'re a rock band. To other people, we\'re an acoustic band. Some people think we\'re rootsy, and others think we\'re arty.\" He pauses to take a breath and to chuckle at the breadth of it all. \"We\'re all of those things.\"\n\nYes, every one of those descriptions is accurate, a snapshot of the truth taken from a different angle. The music of Salas-Humara and his bandmates is the sound of ideas, styles, and maybe even cultures colliding. It deftly combines a big beat with a nothing-wasted leanness, and it\'s music that possesses a unique blending of intensity and approachability, with the ferocious rockers tilting you back on your heels just as quickly as the hushed, tightly coiled ballads draw you closer.\n\nSo how should one sum up the music of the Silos? With a new album on the shelves and a trail of memorable shows (from performances in large music halls to intimate house concerts) both behind them and in front of them, let\'s just call it enduring.\n\nWritten By: —Rick Cornell',15011,118753),(848,'Orchestra Bagutti','',805,4891),(849,'Іван Попович','',1133,6151),(850,'Nina Badric','She was born on 4th of July, 1972 in Zagreb.

His father was the renowned tenor Karl Ots.\n\nBefore studying singing with the Estonian baritone Aleksander Arder in Yaroslavl, where an Estonian cultural centre had been established, Ots was a young Navy Officer who had escaped a sinking ship and taken prisoner in Russia. He was released a year later, and on his return home he auditioned for the conservatory in Tallinn. At the same time, he became a member of the chorus at the Estonian National Theatre in Tallinn. His solo opera debut was a tiny part in Eugene Onegin (1944). He soon became one of the most revered singers with this opera company, with whom he sang with from 1951 until his untimely death in 1975.\n\nOts was also a welcomed performer in all the major opera houses of the former Soviet Union, being especially popular at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. His repertoire included the roles of: Eugene Onegin, Yeletzky, Escamillo, Renato, Don Giovanni, Papageno, Rigoletto, Iago, Porgy, Figaro, and the title role in Kabalevsky\'s [[Colas Breugnon]. Ots sang in Estonian, Russian, Finnish, German, Italian and French, and was fluent in all six languages. Ots\'s most famous role, with which he is often identified with, was the leading character in Anton Rubinstein\'s opera The Demon. The libretto of The Demon is based on Mikhail Lermontov\'s famous epic poem, once banned because of its plot line which involves a misalliance between a dark angel and a Georgian princess. Georg Ots\'s interpretation of the Demon was admired and loved all over Russia, and made Lermontov\'s controversial poem even more famous.\n\nThe popularity of Ots culminated in 1958 with the release of the Lenfilm Studio musical Mister X, based on Imre Kalman\'s operetta Die Zirkusprinzessin. Ots also played a leading role in Between Three Plagues, a film based on a historical novel by Jaan Kross which illuminates the life of Balthasar Russow (played by Ots), a distinguished Estonian writer and chronicler. Russow (1536-1600) was the author of Chronicle of Livonia, a masterpiece which describes the life `of` and `in` Estonia between the 12-th and 16-th century and is one of the most important literary works on Estonian culture and history of that period.\n\nOts loved to perform songs by Schubert, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky and several other Russian composers, and was also a devoted interpreter of Estonian folk songs. His voice could be heard on radio and TV all over the Soviet Union, and all his records sold out almost immediately.\n\nHe also performed successfully in various European countries and in the United States. After his death in 1975, the Estonian Music High School was named after him. A plant, a ferry and a street also bear his name. In 1997, Russian scientists gave his name to a newly discovered minor planet. He was married three times (to Margot, Asta and Ilona Ots respectively) and had two daughters, a son (daughter Ülle and son Ülo with Asta, and daughter Mariann with Ilona) and two adopted sons (Hendrik and Jüri).',10890,110400),(861,'Gian Pieretti','',2540,9920),(862,'Neal Hefti','Neal Hefti (born October 29, 1922 in Hastings, Nebraska - died October 11, 2008 in Toluca Lake, California) was an American jazz trumpeter, composer, and arranger.\n\nHe began arranging professionally in his teens, when he wrote charts for Nat Towles.

He claimed to be the 16th generation of hereditary musicians hailing from the Kalawant. Mehdi Hassan received his musical training and grooming under his father, Ustad Azeem Khan and his uncle Ustad Ismail Khan who were classical musicians and well-versed in Dhrupad and Khayal singing. They instructed him in classical music and voice rendition within the framework of classical forms of Thumri, Dhrupad, Khayal and Dadra, from the young age of eight. After the Partition of India, 20 year-old Mehdi Hassan and his family migrated to Pakistan and suffered severe financial hardships. To make ends meet, Mehdi Hassan began working in a bicycle shop and later became a car and diesel tractor mechanic. Despite the hardships, his passion for music didn\'t wither and he kept up the routine of practice (Riyaaz) on a daily basis.\n\nThe struggle ended when Mehdi Hassan was given the opportunity to sing on Radio Pakistan in 1952, primarily as a Thumri singer, which earned him recognition within the musical fraternity. At the time, Ustad Barkat Ali Khan, Begum Akhtar and Mukhtar Begum were considered the stalwarts of Ghazal Gayaki (genre).\n\nMehdi Hassan also had a passion for Urdu poetry and began to experiment by singing ghazals. He cites  Z.A. Bukhari and Rafiq Anwar, renowned broadcasters and producers of radio Pakistan as additional influences in his progression as a ghazal singer. They gave him ample opportunities to display his mastery over the ghazal on radio. He sang ghazals of all the renowned Urdu poets and his innovative style was soon appreciated by both masses and discerning audiences.\n\nMehdi Hassan’s voice and unique performance skills in ghazal singing were unmatched in the world of South Asian music. The 60s and 70s can be named Mehdi Hassan’s decades, as there was hardly any hero in the Pakistani musical scene on whom Mehdi Hassan’s songs were not filmed.\n\nHe is universally acclaimed as the finest ghazal singer of his time, perhaps of all times. His unsurpassable vocal range and his mastery over even the most difficult of raags makes him the undisputed emperor of ghazals. His popularity amongst the masses, appreciation by the masses, and continued success over five decades makes him at par with Noor Jehan and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan in the league of the greatest Pakistani singers of all time. The ultimate tribute to his greatness was from the eternal nightingale, Lata Mangeshkar, who compared his songs to \" Voice of God \" . Talat Aziz as well as Indian ghazal singer Jagjit Singh are amongst his famous disciples.\n\nFollowing a severe illness in the late 80s, Mehdi Hassan stepped down from playback singing. Later due to severity of his illness he completely departed from music. He now lives a secluded life in Karachi which he has made his permanent residence. Nevertheless he often visits Lahore where he spends most of his time with his children and other family members.\n\nTowards the end of 2000, he suffered his first stroke while in Kerala, India. In 2005, he was taken to India for ayurvedic treatment where he was welcomed by A.B. Vajpayee, Dilip Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and many of his Indian fans. He suffered his second stroke soon after he returned from India which left him with speech impairments and limited his physical mobility.

Despite the sizable following she had been able to acquire in a relatively short period of time, Kim Anh\'s road to fame would not be without its challenges.\nAfter having achieved such notoriety as a local performer in the Vietnamese community of Washington, D.C., Kim Anh was invited to perform at the 1977 Summer Vietnamese Festival of Performing Arts, Dai Nhac Hoi He \'77, that had been organized by veteran actress of South Vietnamese cinema, Tuy Hong.  At the festival, Kim Anh would deliver an unforgettable performance of Qian Yan Wan Yu (A Thousand Words) in Mandarin and left the audience that was 1,000 strong in attendance with a lasting impression.  Within weeks after her triumphant performance which formally had introduced her to the Vietnamese-American community on a grander scale, Kim Anh was involved in a near fatal automobile accident.  Wheelchair bound for nearly two years, her rehabilitation would be a slow and painful process.  According to Kim Anh, this was when she began her addiction with drugs that had been prescribed to her by doctors for pain treatment.\nIn 1982, Kim Anh recorded her first studio solo album entitled Mua Thu La Bay.  The title track was a cover of the theme song of The Young Ones, a Taiwanese romance film in 1972 starring Chen Chen that was extremely popular with movie audiences of South Vietnam.  Other memorable tracks recorded on the album included Le Da written by Tran Trinh, Diem Xua written by Trinh Cong Son, Xin Con Goi Ten Nhau written by Truong Sa and Nua Dem Ngoai Pho written by Truc Phuong.  The album would become one of the all time bestsellers in the history of the overseas Vietnamese music industry.\n\nThe overwhelming success of Mua Thu La Bay instantly turned Kim Anh into a star and made her one of the busiest overseas Vietnamese singers during the 1980s and the 1990s.  She performed at live shows for overseas Vietnamese communities all over the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia and collaborated with numerous music production labels such as Da Lan, Doi Magazine, Truong Thanh, Thanh Lan, Lang Van, Asia Productions and Thuy Nga Paris.  She continued to release a series of solo studio albums and also recorded a duet album with Duy Quang, Mat Le Nguoi Tinh, for the Thanh Lan label released in 1984.  Her recording of Toc Em Chua Ua Nang He written by Pham Manh Cuong was the featured song during the opening credits of volume 3 of the popular video series, Paris By Night, in 1986.  Three years later, Kim Anh made her debut performance on the Paris By Night stage with Tam Hon Co Don written by Anh Bang.  Before Nguyen Cao Ky Duyen and Nguyen Ngoc Ngan became the permanent hosts of Paris By Night, Kim Anh and Tran Quoc Bao were the first returning hosts of the popular video series as the pair had hosted volume 15 in 1991 and volume 18 in 1992.  Other memorable appearances by Kim Anh on the Paris By Night stage included her performances of Mua Thu Yeu Duong, Gio Nay Anh O Dau and Tinh Ca Mua He.  In the 2000s, she made several well received appearances on the popular video series produced by Asia Productions which included duet performances with Tuan Vu, Thien Kim and most notably, Thai Doanh Doanh, in a rendition of her signature song, Mua Thu La Bay.  In 1994, Kim Anh released her solo music videotape entitled Duong Xua Loi Cu which consisted of music videos to several of her recorded songs filmed in Vietnam.  Among her other popular recorded songs include Sao Danh Xa Em, Canh Hong Trung Quoc and Nang Chieu.  It should be noted that Kim Anh was the very first overseas Vietnamese singer to have made an impact in Vietnamese music as she had risen to fame years before the likes of Ngoc Lan, Kieu Nga and Nhu Mai had come along.   \nIn recent years, Kim Anh has spent most of her time living and working in Vietnam.  Now in her sixties, she has long overcome her previous battle with drug addiction and continues a fast paced schedule of nightly performances at various venues in Ho Chi Minh City along with concert tours all over Vietnam.  Kim Anh is a mother of two grown sons.

In fact, Y lan did not start singing professionally until a few years ago. According to Y Lan, she was encouraged to pursue education instead of the arts while growing up in Vietnam.\n\nWhile she was still in Vietnam, Y Lan owned a cafe to host a number of artists who remained in the country after 1975.

He wrote outrageous short stories for the school papers and in 1968 he also published the sheet music and lyrics to 14 songs, many of which would be released on his first records. As a young bohemian writer, he was inspired by Bob Dylan and Ray Davies, and embarked into songwriting, but his works were not copies of the American or British idols, but in fact, his songs were very original.\n\nAt the beginning of the seventies, his music works were not accessible to the audience as Megas only performed them to his friends of the left-wing circles. However in 1972, Icelandic students in Oslo, Norway helped him release his first album, in which diabolic and satiric lyrics were accompanied by a mild acoustic music played by Norwegian folk musicians. This work caused controversy and was his music was banned by the Icelandic national radio, but Megas became a cult figure in the growing alternative scene.\n\nIn 1973, as Megas found it difficult to release further albums, he published his verses and music in 3 books.\n\nWhen his original lyrics were performed with the electric rock band Judas in 1975, Megas managed to reach a broader audience. Several of those songs lampooned the Icelandic cultural legacy, including his two next albums: Millilending (1975) and Fram og aftur blindgötuna (1976), which were much heavier than the first one. He focused on topics that challenged all of Icelandic society’s taboos with references made to classical literature and a sarcastic revisionist history. His work polarized the audience, splitting them into a hostile minority and an enthusiastic majority. His songs remarkable poetry and use of Icelandic language proved a novel way to boost Icelandic rock and roll.\n\nIn 1977 Megas released Á bleikum náttkjólum with the accompaniment of Spilverk þjóðanna, a very popular folk-rock band. This album was voted the best Icelandic album ever made, and with a variety of music styles, it features what many critics considered the first Icelandic punk song. By the end of the seventies, Megas was perceived as a provocateur and his important roll in the Icelandic rock scene turned him into a reference for future artists.\n\nThen, he released a children’s song album and a double live album and withdrew from the Icelandic music and started working as a dock worker and graduated from arts school.\n\nBy 1983 reappeared in the Icelandic music scene by collaborating with other bands and playing as a guest musicians on several albums.\n\nTowards 1985 joined KUKL in a new project was named MEGAKUKL and toured all over Iceland recording around 20 songs which still remain as unpublished material.\nAfter seven years of absence, his solo career was resumed in 1986 with the release of Í góðri trú.\n\nThree albums by Megas have featured Björk as backing vocalist; Loftmynd (1987), Höfuðlausnir (1988) and Hættuleg hljómsveit og glæpakvendið Stella (1990).

Hann gekk í Austurbæjarskólann og svo í Menntaskólann í Reykjavík, þaðan sem hann lauk stúdentsprófi árið 1965. Þá vann hann um hríð sem gjaldkeri í Landsbankanum, en hélt svo til Noregs til að stunda nám í þjóðháttafræði við háskólann í Osló.\n\nMegas byrjaði snemma að fást við lagasmíðar og textagerð, og samdi meðal annars lagið um Gamla sorrí Grána fyrir fermingu. Áður en fyrsta hljómplata hans kom út í Noregi árið 1972 komu út eftir hann tvö hefti með textum, nótum og teikningum. Þau hétu einfaldlega Megas I (1968) og Megas II (1970). Árið 1973 gaf hann heftin tvö út aftur, endurskoðuð, og bætti þriðja heftinu við, Megas III. Margt af því efni sem birtist í heftunum átti síðar eftir að rata inn á plöturnar hans.\n\nÁ áttunda áratugnum gaf Megas út sex hljómplötur. Tónlist hans hristi upp í samfélaginu og mörgum var ekki hlýtt til „guðlastarans“ og „dópistans“ Megasar. Eftir fræga tónleika í MH haustið 1978, Drög að sjálfsmorði, sem einnig voru gefnir út á tvöfaldri plötu, tóku við nokkur ár þar sem Megas lét lítið fara fyrir sér opinberlega. Hann fór í áfengismeðferð skömmu eftir Sjálfsmorðstónleikana, en eftir þá gengu þær sögur að hann hefði fyrirfarið sér. Að meðferðinni lokinni útvegaði hann sér verkamannavinnu og stundaði myndlistarnám í Myndlista- og handíðaskólanum. Í nokkur ár lét hann sér nægja að fylgjast með rokkinu af hliðarlínunni, en um þetta leyti var pönkið loksins að koma til landsins. Árið 1983 steig hann aftur á svið, í þetta sinn með Íkarusi, hljómsveit Tolla Morthens, og söng með þeim nokkur lög. Auk þess söng hann lög í félagi við Bubba Morthens inn á plötu hans, Fingraför. Megas gaf svo sjálfur ekki út plötu fyrr en árið 1986, en þá höfðu sjö ár liðið frá því að síðasta plata hans kom út. Þá var heildarsafn hans einnig endurútgefið með einhverjum viðbótum. Síðan þá hefur Megas sent frá sér nýjar plötur með nokkuð reglulegu millibili. Níu plötur Megasar má finna á lista yfir hundrað bestu plötur tuttugustu aldar á Íslandi í bókinni Eru ekki allir í stuði (2001) eftir Dr. Gunna.\n\nMegas hefur ekki takmarkað sig við dægurlagaformið. Hann byrjaði snemma að skrifa smásögur, sem sumar birtust í Tímariti Máls og menningar á sjöunda áratugnum. Árið 1990 kom út eftir hann og Þórunni Valdimarsdóttur Sól í Norðurmýri - píslarsaga úr Austurbæ, sem byggir á æskuminningum hans. Fyrsta skáldsaga hans, Björn og Sveinn leit svo dagsins ljós árið 1994. Hann hefur einnig skrifað leikrit, þýtt og staðfært og svo mætti lengi telja. Safn dægurlagatexta hans kom út árið 1991 í bókinni Textar.\n\nSjónbeinendur Megasar eru yfirleitt úr neðri stigum samfélagsins. Þeir eru rónar, dópistar og aðrir níðingar.\n\nÍ textum sínum tekst Megas á við þær miklu þjóðfélagsbreytingar sem áttu sér stað á Íslandi allan seinni hluta tuttugustu aldarinnar. Á fyrstu árum ferilsins voru túlkanir hans á Íslandssögunni og útleggingar á boðskap kristninnar mörgum þyrnir í augum, og sum laga hans fengu ekki spilun í Ríkisútvarpinu, sem þá var eina útvarpsstöðin á Íslandi. Fjandskapurinn gekk svo langt hjá sumum að árið 1978 sömdu Búbónisbræður, þeir Jónas og Jón Múli Árnasynir leikrit, \'Valmúinn springur út á nóttunni\', sem virtist gera út á það eitt að gera lítið úr persónu Megasar, en Jón Múli skrifaði nokkrar lesendagreinar í Þjóðviljann veturinn 1976-1977 þar sem hann varaði við þessum manni. Á þessum tíma var það svall Megasar sem truflaði, og vissulega var það mikið. Þessar raddir þögnuðu þó smám saman eftir að Megas dró sig út af sjónarsviðinu í kringum 1980.\n\nÞegar hann var svo kominn vel af stað aftur á síðari hluta níunda áratugarins, var enn og aftur farið að slúðra um hann. Í þetta skipti stóð það ýmist í tengslum við meinta samkynhneigð hans og ást hans til barna. Í nokkrum lögum frá þessum tíma ber ástir til barna á góma, í ýmsum myndum þó. Hvassaleitisdóninn fjallar um flassara sem börnum þótti helst standa ógn af á þeim tíma. Litlir sætir strákar vekja enn hneykslun góðborgara þó lagið sé orðið meira en 15 ára gamalt, en í því syngur hann um hvernig kvenkynið er lævíst og svikult, og það að litlir sætir strákar hafi löngum reynst best. Margir réðu því af textanum að Megas væri samkynhneigður barnaníðingur. Megas ferðaðist einnig til Tælands um þetta leyti og mörg laga hans, sérstaklega af Höfuðlausnum, bera áhrifum þaðan glöggt vitni. Þar má meðal annars finna lagið Drengirnir í Bangkok, þar sem fjallað er um blíðu drengjanna þar. Vinur Megasar kom með honum frá Tælandi, 16 ára gamall tælenskur piltur. Fólki þótti því ljóst að innistæða væri fyrir kjaftasögunum. Þetta dugði til að vekja hneykslun góðborgaranna enn á ný - fólks sem tekið hafði Megas í sátt eftir að hann hætti mesta sukkinu.\n\nÞað verður þó ekki fram hjá því horft, að umfjöllun Megasar um þá anga samfélagsins sem ekki mátti ræða, tabúin, höfðu heilmikil áhrif í samfélagsumræðu á Íslandi. Það er líklega óhætt að segja að hann hafi verið tíu árum á undan öðrum að benda Íslendingum á að til sé fólk sem ber ást til barna sem lítið á skylt við kristilegan kærleik. Eins má þakka honum umfjöllunina um rónana í textum hans á áttunda áratugnum, en um þá var ekki rætt opinberlega fram að því. Í báðum þessum tilvikum braut Megas ísinn.',33667,302868),(893,'Anna Toledo','Anna Toledo is an Brazilian Actress/Singer/Songwriter born in Curitiba, Paraná (southern region of Brazil).

During her childhood, she lived in France and later in London, where she faced antisemitism and physical abuse from classmates. As a result, she decided to change her first name to “Si,” a family nickname, once she was old enough.\n\nAt age 12, she returned to Israel on her own and rejoined Kibbutz Beit Alfa, where she lived as a “child from outside.” At 13, she wrote and composed her first song, Ten Lanu Lichyot (“Let Us Live”), which won first place in a school music competition.\n\nHiman rose to prominence in the israeli rock scene during the 80s and became one of its defining voices. With a raw and emotional performance style, she stood out in a male-dominated genre and became a trailblazer for women in Israeli rock. Her breakthrough came with the hit Tel Aviv 89, which captured the restless spirit of urban youth and remains a cult classic. Her rendition of Kmo Tzemach Bar (“Like a Wild Plant”), originally written by her father, is considered one of her most iconic performances, blending personal legacy with national sentiment.\n\nOver the years, she released several acclaimed albums, collaborated with leading Israeli musicians, and appeared in film, theater, and television. Her music often reflects themes of personal struggle, independence, love, and social identity. Despite career highs and personal challenges, Himan continues to perform and record, and is recognized today as a seminal figure in Israeli music history—respected both for her artistry and her uncompromising authenticity.\n\nhttps://www.last.fm/music/סי+היימן\n\nWiki: https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/סי_היימן',577,3851),(900,'Ion Dolanescu','Ion Dolănescu (n. 25 ianuarie 1944, Perşinari, Dâmboviţa, România, d. 19 martie 2009, Bucureşti, România)[1] a fost un cântăreţ român de muzică populară şi deputat în legislatura 2000-2004, ales în judeţul Ilfov pe listele partidului PRM.[2]\n\nIon Dolănescu s-a născut în satul Perşinari, judeţul Damboviţa.[1]\n\nÎn 1961 a urmat-o pe Maria Tănase într-un turneu de două-trei săptămâni prin judeţul Dâmboviţa.

He was known for his style which fuses pop, rock, folk, world music and for his extensive vocal range. He is best known for the song \"Oro\", from his 1986 breakout album release Odissea. Other hits include \"Lei verrà\", \"Mediterraneo\", \"Bella d\'estate\", \"Amore per te\", \"Come Monnalisa\", \"Nella mia città\" and \"La rondine\".\n\nMango has been defined by Italian music author Mario Luzzatto Fegiz as an \"authentic innovator of Italian pop music\"[1] and AllMusic considers him an \"Italian rock fusion innovator\".[2] He wrote songs for Italian artists such as Patty Pravo, Loredana Bertè, Andrea Bocelli, Mietta. Part of his repertoire was performed by Italian and foreign musicians, including Mina, Mia Martini, Leo Sayer, Hélène Ségara and Eleftheria Arvanitaki. [from Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango_(singer)]\n\n2) Mango, the popular Lithuanian pop girl trio, formed in 1998 with the aim of producing music that would resonate with their audience. The group was created and produced by brothers Mindaugas Bendžius and Gintaras Bendžius, who held a special competition to select the members of the band. After the competition, Rima Petrauskytė, Viktorija Perminaitė and Asta Bridikytė were chosen to join Mango. \n\nThe band\'s launch was an immediate success with the covers of \"Pavasariniai žiedai\" (Spring Blossoms) and \"Svetimi\" (Strangers). Mango continued to achieve impressive milestones throughout their career, releasing nine albums that collectively sold over 310,000 copies. The band was recognized as the Band of the Year by Radiocentras Awards in 2000 and 2001 and by Bravo Awards in 2000. \n\nIn 2004, Mango faced a significant change when Asta Bridikytė left the group and was replaced by Lina Kaklytė. Despite the change, the band continued to produce music and entertain their audience. However, in 2007, Mango announced their retirement after releasing their third compilation of their best songs. They embarked on a farewell tour across Lithuania, including special appearances for Lithuanian communities in England, Ireland, and the United States. The final concert took place on March 31, 2008, at Šiauliai Arena, bringing an end to the band\'s ten-year career.\n\nIn 2014, Mango singer Rima Petrauskytė-Paulauskienė and the Bendžius brothers reunited MANGO with new members and continued releasing music under the new name \"MAN-GO\". Their return was a welcome development for their fans who had missed their music. \n\nIn 2018, Mango reached a significant milestone - their 20th anniversary in the Lithuanian music industry. This was a remarkable achievement for the band, and to commemorate the occasion, they released their 11th studio album, \"2020\". The album was an embodiment of Mango\'s signature sound, combining traditional Lithuanian folk music with contemporary pop beats and lyrics that celebrated love, life, and the human experience. \"2020\" was met with widespread acclaim from Mango\'s loyal fanbase and music critics alike, cementing the band\'s position as one of the most influential and enduring acts in Lithuanian music history.',94859,1039983),(932,'Durga Rangila','',754,2916),(933,'Christina Milian','Christina Milian (born Christine Marie Flores on September 26, 1981) is an American rnb and pop singer-songwriter, record producer, dancer, actress, and former MTV VJ. \n\nMilian was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, to Cuban parents Don and Carmen. She has two younger sisters, Dannielle and Elizabeth. Her family moved to Waldorf, Maryland soon after her birth and she set her heart on an entertainment career at the age of four. Milian shot commercials for (Wendy\'s, Honeycomb) and played the lead role in the musical Annie before moving to Los Angeles at thirteen to pursue an acting career. Soon after the family\'s move, her father divorced her mother. Milian graduated from Westlake High School in Waldorf, Maryland; and also attended Matthew Henson Middle School in Indian Head, Maryland.\n\nIn 2000, Milian made her first official musical appearance on Ja Rule\'s second studio album Rule 3:36, performing guest vocals on his song \"Between Me and You\". Released as the album\'s lead single in 2001, the track managed to peak at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and in the top 30 of the UK singles chart, building Milian\'s reputation as a singer. Milian also appeared in Mýa\'s video for \"Best of Me\" playing a friend. In the meantime Milian co-wrote and provided extensive backing vocals for the track \"Play\" for Jennifer Lopez\'s 2001 album J. Lo which became another success. Milian would later pass down the song to Lopez because of already having a club song with \"AM to PM\" as promotion. She also went on to co-write \"Same Ol\' Same Ol\", the first single from girl group PYT\'s debut album Down With Me.\n\nIn 2001, Milian eventually released her first solo single, \"AM to PM\", off her self-titled debut album. The song became a worldwide hit reaching the top 5 in the UK and Denmark, top 10 in the Netherlands, and top 30 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and in Australia. The success of \"AM to PM\" sparked the international release of the Christina Milian album which she co-wrote and produced, although not in the United States. The second single \"When You Look At Me\" was another international hit reaching the top 5 in the UK, Netherlands, and Ireland and making the top 40 in Denmark, Germany, Australia, and France. Although a music video for the album\'s third single \"Get Away\" (another collaboration with Ja Rule) was filmed in Paris, the single was not released officially.\n\nAfterwards Milian also was featured on the track \"It\'s All Gravy\", a duet with British Rapper Romeo of the UK garage group So Solid Crew. While the song was another UK top ten hit single in 2002, Milian provided the theme song for the hit Disney series Kim Possible, \"Call Me, Beep Me\" later that year. In 2002, she also collaborated with Hilary Duff on her Christmas album Santa Claus Lane, on the song \"I Heard Santa on the Radio.\"\n\nIn 2003, Milian started recording songs with Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, Bloodshy & Avant and Cory Rooney for her first U.S. release, It\'s About Time (whose title is a direct reference to how long it had taken for one of her albums to be released domestically). The album was released to positive reviews on July 13, 2004, but failed to receive immense commercial success when it debuted at #21 in the UK and #14 on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling over 36,000 copies in the first week only. While It\'s about Time ended up with lackluster sales of 394,000 copies in the United States, it gained prominence when it received a Grammy nomination for \"Best Contemporary R&B Album\" in 2005.\n\nThe album\'s first single, \"Dip It Low\" (written by singer Teedra Moses and Black Eyed Peas producer Poli Paul) however, became Milian\'s biggest hit to date, when it peaked at #1 on a world composite dance chart (compiled on data from the U.S., UK, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Australia), simultaneously reaching #2 in the UK, #5 in the U.S., #7 in New Zealand and the top 20 in Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands. The single was also certified Gold by the RIAA for digital sales. The album\'s second and final single, \"Whatever U Want\" (featuring Joe Budden) failed to reprise the success of the lead single, but again reached the top 10 in the UK as well as charting on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nMilian\'s third studio album So Amazin\' was released on May 16, 2006. Milian worked with Cool & Dre on the majority of the production of the album, and the project was finished with additional help from Rich Harrison and executive producers Jay-Z and LA Reid. Christina mentions working with Cool & Dre for the entire album \"made a more consistent, very real and personal album\" compared to her other works. The record\'s first single \"Say I\" featured rapper Young Jeezy and was released in March 2006 as a single and video. The song made it to number 1 on iTunes UK Music Store and was number 1 on AOL music, but altogether saw moderate success only with peak positions on #21 in the United States, #4 in the UK and #45 in Australia.\n\nWhile So Amazin\' failed to reach the top 10 when it debuted at #11 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the album saw minor international success only, peaking at #67 in the UK inter alia. With \"Gonna Tell Everybody\" a second single from the album was chosen, but Island Def Jam neither agreed to film a music video nor booked promotional appearances for Milian to promote the song. In June 2006, instead, Milian\'s representative confirmed that she had left the Island Def Jam record label due to \"creative differences\" - though disappointing album sales were believed to be the main factor, since the album sold less than 500,000 worldwide (over 130,000 in United States).\n\nDue to the low sales of So Amazin\', Milian released her first compilation album, titled The Best of Christina Milian on November 22, 2006. The album was released under the Universal International label. The album includes her hit singles and songs that she hand picked herself from her first three studio albums, Christina Milian, It\'s About Time, and So Amazin\', though, only one track, Say I, was chosen from So Amazin\', possibly due to the fact that it is her lowest selling album. The album was only released in Japan and some other Asian countries; but was not released in the U.S. or Europe. The album peaked at a disappointing #29 on the Japanese ORICON Albums Chart, and has sold only 38,078 copies to date.\n\nFollowing her departure from Island Def Jam Music Group, Milian signed with MySpace Records in 2008. She began writing songs and recording in the studio with numerous different producers, including Cool & Dre, J. R. Rotem, The Runners, Danja, Madd Scientist, T-Pain, Jim Jonsin and Toby Gad. Milian was featured on the cover of Rap-Up\'s 2008 Winter issue, in which she announced that the album\'s title was Dream in Color. A single was released in October 2008, ballad \"Us Against the World\". It was written by Milian and produced by Madd Scientist. The single, described by Milian as a \"cinematic power ballad\", premiered via MySpace on October 6, 2008, and was made available by digital download the next day. Milian felt that Madd Scientist \"brought the best out of me\" while producing \"Us Against the World\", and \"was really able to do some amazing things with my vocals\".\n\nAfter recording songs with the aforementioned producers, Milian took a break from music and started filming Bring It On: Fight to the Finish. When Milian returned to music, she concentrated on promoting her single \"Us Against the World\", and shot its music video. Since then, Milian said that she became \"a little bit more meticulous with what I feel deserved to be on the album\", and resumed recording. Songs recorded for the album included the 90\'s Madonna-styled ballad \"Stay\", Euro-club record \"Tug of War\" and the feel-good song \"Diamonds\", which featured Kanye West. Other features included Rick Ross on the Cool & Dre produced track \"Blissful\", and Pitbull.\n\nIn early 2009, Milian began working with The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, and L.O.S. Da Maestro, which led to her signing a deal with Radio Killa Records. Milian revealed that aside from \"Us Against the World\", The-Dream and Tricky Stewart would be producing all the songs on her album. In March 2009, Milian changed the album\'s title to Elope. Regarding the album\'s title change, Milian explained, \"the definition of elope is to run away secretly with one\'s beloved. This next album is about taking responsibility for yourself and making your own decisions.\" In June 2009, The-Dream said that the album was finished. Upon completion of the album, Milian said it represented \"independence, not having to answer to any type of \'authority\', being a woman at her best and feeling very confident\". She said that fans could expect an \"edgy sound with lots of strong powerful anthems. Big up tempos, R&B and Pop at it\'s [sic] best and two big ballads\".\n\nIn August 2009, Milian confirmed that she had signed a deal to release Elope through Interscope Records, with a 2010 release date. Originally scheduled to be released in 2009, Tricky Stewart explained the delay, saying \"we just got our label deals done, so the reason why some of these projects got delayed had to do with technicalities and things of that nature\". The album has been furthered delayed because of Milian\'s marriage to The-Dream and her pregnancy. In January 2010, Milian said that she was going back into the studio in the summer to record more material. Although the album had already been finished when Milian took a break for her pregnancy, she wanted to \"go back and re-do some of the music and make some new songs and find my new inspiration\". In October 2009, Tricky Stewart said that another single had yet to be chosen, and that it would be the first single off Elope. Reported choices for the first single include \"Zipper\", \"I\'m a Cheat\", and \"Supersonic\".\n\nOn February 26, 2010, Milian gave birth to their daughter Violet, although in July 2010, The-Dream announced that he and Milian had separated. Milian was scheduled to resume recording in July 2010 to complete the album; however, after her separation from The-Dream, Milian opted to focus on her acting career. Despite the separation, Milian and The-Dream continued to \"work together and write together\". At the 2010 Los Angeles Fashion Week, Milian performed \"Zipper\" and \"Dip It Low\". At the 2010 American Music Awards, Milian announced that her untitled fourth studio album will be released in 2011.',770902,5686690),(934,'Carl Belew','Carl was born in Salina, Oklahoma April 21, 1931.

Her debut album, Främling, sold around one million copies and remains the biggest-selling album in Swedish music history. She has also worked as a songwriter. During her 25-year long career, she has recorded many top-selling albums and singles and is referred to as Sweden\'s most prominent female singer. Some of her biggest hits include Främling (English: Stranger) from 1983, Tommy tycker om mig (Tommy likes me) from 1984, Fångad av en stormvind (Captured by a Lovestorm) from 1991, All the Reasons to Live from 1992, I Believe in Love from 2001, Genom allt (Through it all) from 2005 and Evighet (Eternity) from 2006.

Carola, a Brazilian DJ and producer born in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, has made significant strides in the electronic music scene. At 26 years old, she gained support from David Guetta for track, FKGO, with Kohen. This collaboration marks a major professional achievement for Carola, who views Guetta as a key influencer in the popularization of electronic music. Despite facing initial skepticism in her career, Carola\'s determination led her to success. Starting her journey in 2007, she immersed herself in electronic music, later delving into DJing in 2012. Overcoming financial constraints, she leveraged online resources to learn and eventually formed a close partnership with Kohen, whom she considers one of Brazil\'s top producers.\nCarola\'s family initially doubted her decision to pursue a career in music due to financial concerns, but they now take pride in her achievements. Inspired by Beyoncé and influenced by electronic artists like Flume, Skrillex, and Diplo, Carola continually evolves her musical identity. Facing challenges and criticism, she maintains resilience, believing in her capacity to achieve anything she sets her mind to.

At the age of 14, she began performing regularly for major outdoor music venues and dance halls in Ho Chi Minh City.  In 1998, with the encouragement from both her parents, particularly her mother who was also a professional singer known by her stage name, Thanh Truc, Thien Kim entered the prestigious talent competition, Tieng Hat Truyen Hinh Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh, where she impressively placed second with her solo performance of Xa Vang, a song written by composer Nguyen Van Hien.\nDuring her freshman year in college, Thien Kim along with her family left their native Vietnam and emigrated to the United States on May of 1995.

The album features production by Floyd the Locsmif (Atl), Hezekiah, James Poysner (Philly), Probe DMS, Fire Dept., (NYC), Oddisee (DC), and J-Live himself. \"The title is a play on words. People think of the here after as the after life or somewhere you go when you die. Like heaven or hell. Me personally, I see heaven as being at peace with yourself while you\'re alive. I see hell as the path you choose in life as opposed to a place you go after death. The album is called The Hear After because I\'m at peace with myself musically, and I\'ve been through hell to get that way. This is what you \"hear after\" all that has transpired so far. This is what I\'ve been working to accomplish since the last album.\"\n\nLike J\'s last two full length records, The Best Part and All of the Above, The Hear After covers a wide range of thoughts and emotions both musically and with its subject matter. \"If you were to look at the whole thing, you would see a story line about an artist trying to maintain and expand his career and still be there for his family. That was the biggest struggle while making the record, and its no coincidence that it\'s a theme that becomes obvious listening to it. But there are songs about almost every aspect of my life from growing up in the city, to raising kids, touring heavy, building and teaching, politics, party and bullshit. I can\'t just spit about one thing for a whole record. That\'s not my style.\"\n\nJ-Live has been rhyming and mixing since the age of 12 but he has made much more of a name for himself as an MC than as a DJ. \"I definitely focus on rhyming more. Growing up doing both it was easier on the pockets to be an MC. Records and equipment can get expensive. But I love spinning.\" One of the highlights of his entertaining live show is when he rhymes and beat juggles on the turntables simultaneously, performing his classic, \"Braggin\' Writes.\" J-Live is also known to produce beats.\n\nJ-Live has always used music to get his messages across. He explains, \"I grew up listening to everything from BDP to NWA, to PE [[artist]Public Enemy], Slick Rick, Big Daddy Kane, Nice and Smooth. Whether the music was pimped out, gangsta, militant or whatever, rappers had something important to say to kids like me. And I listened intently. As a 5%er, I can\'t imagine how much of an influence hip hop had on the way I see the world.\"\n\nCase in point, J\'s favorite song on the album, \"Audio Visual\" is so descriptive it\'s a song \"in 3-D\". From the quirky, key accents to the thick-ass bottom running throughout the song, J-Live paints a colorful, picture of his life on and off the mic. \"Brooklyn Public\" is his ode to his days as an educator.

But, all this talent was put on hold as Ramos went to the TDC penitentiary for five years.\n\nResuming a free life in 1997, Ramos by chance tattooed Dope House rapper Low G, who invited him out to a South Park Mexican concert. South Park Mexican turned out to be old schoolmate Carlos Coy reinvented as a Latino rap sensation. That began Ramos\' unofficial rap-game apprenticeship as \"Juan Gotti\" with SPM and Dope House Records, filling in for Low G at low rider and rap shows around Houston from 1998.\n\nCiting DJ Screw, Street Military, Ramón Ayala and Control Machete as influences, Gotti\'s first single \"Mira Lo Que Pasa\" a year later \"blew up,\" as he puts it. The full album, No Set Trippin\', dropped in 2002, quickly snapped up a Latin Grammy® nomination and sold enough units to go \"ghetto gold\" (more than 50,000 by street standards).\n\n\"I thank Jesus. Glory to God,\" Gotti praises of his successes, \"Faith has kept me focused and Dope House has done wonders. Everyone was freaked out about how fast I moved up. Things happen for a reason because of God.\"\n\nGotti collaborated with Kings One, El Tri, La Traición and La Mafia, laying down vocals for their recent album, Para El Pueblo, and also featured Tejano-norteño band Los Palominos on Gotti\'s next album. So, fans don\'t have to wait to hear Gotti-they can get a sampler of what\'s to come off any of these other projects. He also has a series of underground mixtapes, El Más Locote, Vol. 1 & 2.\n\nMeanwhile, Gotti kicks things off with simultaneous releases for distinct markets-the first single \"Incondicional\" with La Traición for the regional Mexican market off upcoming album Juan Gotti aka John Ghetto drops in early 2005; alongside hip-hop track \"You Don\'t Wanna\"; and cumbia offering \"Para El Pueblo\" with La Mafia. The rush is followed up by a solid tour kicking off in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2005 then touring throughout Mexico, Texas, Cali, the Midwest, Miami, Colombia, and Argentina.',39995,207120),(984,'KRS-One','KRS-One (born Lawrence Parker on August 20, 1965 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York) is an American hip-hop MC. Over his career he has been known by several pseudonyms, including Kris Parker, KRS One, KRS-ONE (as given at his site), The Blastmaster and The Teacha. KRS-One is an acronym for \"Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody\". KRS-One is a significant figure in the hip hop community and is often referenced in works by other hip hop artists and critics as being the \'essence\' of an MC and one of the greatest to ever hold the mic.\n\nKRS-One, originally a member of the hip hop crew Boogie Down Productions, is known for setting the path for both hardcore rap and socially conscious political rap.\n\nYouth and early career\n\nBorn Lawrence Parker in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1965, the future KRS-One grew up with his brother Kenny and their single mother in assorted inner city neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the Bronx. According to interviews with The Source Magazine, one fateful day when he was 12 years old, he and his brother Kenny prepared a pan of flavored rice, which was to be the family\'s dinner for the evening. The hungry pair ate the whole thing, and when their mother came home from work, she kicked them out of the apartment in a fit of anger. They stayed away for two days before younger Kenny decided to go back home, while Lawrence opted not to return. He spent the better part of the next seven years homeless, much of it at local libraries.\n\nIn his late teen years, Lawrence Parker fell in with some illegal drug dealers and became a courier. Using a bread delivery truck as a cover, Parker and his partner drove around town to make drops. During one of their trips, a police car pulled up behind them with flashing lights. Parker\'s partner panicked, and led the cops on a chase for several miles which ended with the truck crashing and the two being apprehended. At the trial, the judge made the commentary that the only reason the police had initially tried to pull them over was because they had private plates on a commercial vehicle, there was no original intent to search for drugs.\n\nParker, still a minor, claimed he was a ward of the state, and got sent to a juvenile home for his sentencing, after which he was moved to a Covenant House youth homeless shelter. It was there that he met Scott Sterling, a recent college graduate who just started working at the shelter as a social worker. Parker discovered that Sterling moonlighted as a hip hop DJ under the name Scott La Rock. By this time, Parker had earned the nickname \"Kris\" from the relationship he had developed with local Hare Krishnas that evangelized near the shelter. Heavily influenced by Eastern philosophies, he was also an aspiring rapper, and practiced routines in verbal spars with the other shelter residents.\n\nParker and Sterling, along with two other fellows, decided to form a rap group together, initially calling themselves \"Scott La Rock and the Celebrity Three\". That was short-lived, however, as the two peripheral members quit, leaving Parker (now calling himself KRS-One) and Sterling. They then decided to call themselves \"Boogie Down Productions\". Success is the Word, a 12-inch single release on indie Fresh/Sleeping Bag Records (under the group name \"12:41\") did not enjoy commercial success. Soon after, the pair approached another NY indie, Rock Candy Productions, for a deal. As it turns out, the entertainment company was allegedly a front for a pornography operation, but Parker and Sterling convinced the boss to front them the money to record an album, under the newly created subsidiary label, B-Boy Records. After a few 12-inch single releases, the Criminal Minded album finally surfaced in 1987.\n\nCriminal Minded featured many dis tracks that attacked other hip hop emcees and tracks about street crime (\"wa da da deng wa da da da deng, listen to my nine millimeter go bang\"). KRS One and La Rock appeared on the cover of the album holding firearms, a controversial precedent that would be followed by many rap artists in the years to follow. Musically, the album was based around James Brown samples and reggae influences. They also sampled hard-rock band AC/DC on \"Dope Beat\". During these years, KRS-One was also famously involved in a hip hop battle with MC Shan, of Queensbridge. KRS objected to MC Shan calling Queensbridge the home of hip hop, and attacked him viciously on a seminal battle rap, The Bridge Is Over.\n\nLater career and emphasis on political issues\n\nFollowing the fatal shooting of Scott La Rock in 1987, Boogie Down Productions (BDP) became increasingly political. KRS One was the primary motivation behind the HEAL compilation and the Stop the Violence Movement. KRS One attracted many prominent emcees to appear on the 12-inch single \"Self Destruction.\" As Parker adopted this more conscientious, less violent approach, he stopped calling himself \"The Blastmaster\" (his battle rap nickname), and instead began calling himself \"The Teacha\", turning the nickname KRS-ONE into the backronym \"Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone\".\n\nOn his first solo album, 1993\'s Return of the Boombap, KRS worked together with producers DJ Premier (Gang Starr), Showbiz and Kid Capri. The catchy yet very hardcore track \"Sound of da Police\" is featured on this album. His second album, KRS One featured Channel Live on the track \"Free Mumia\", a political protest song about Mumia Abu-Jamal, an imprisoned African-American and Black Panther member who a vocal group of activists on the political Left claim is innocent of the crime of which he was convicted. Other prominent guest artists on KRS One included Mad Lion, Busta Rhymes, Das EFX and Fat Joe.\n\nIn 1997, Parker surprised many with his release of the album I Got Next. The record included a remix of the single \"Step into a World\" which featured a sample from the 1970s rock group Blondie by commercial rap icon Puff Daddy. \"Heartbeat\", featuring Angie Martinez and Redman, was based on the old school classic \"Feel the Heartbeat\" by the Treacherous Three. These collaborations with notably mainstream artists took many fans and observers of the vehemently anti-mainstream KRS One by surprise. However, in August 1997 KRS One appeared on Tim Westwood\'s BBC Radio 1 show and vociferously denounced the DJ and the radio station more generally, accusing them of ignoring his style of hip-hop in favour of commercial artists such as Puff Daddy.\n\nIn 1999, there were tentative plans to release an album called \"Maximum Strength\"; a lead single, \"5 Boroughs\", was released on The Corruptor movie soundtrack. However, KRS apparently decided to abort the album\'s planned release, just as he had secured a position as a Vice-President of A&R at Reprise Records. KRS moved to southern California, and stayed there for two years, finally ending his relationship with Jive Records with A Retrospective in 2000. The next year, he resigned his position at Reprise and in 2001 The Sneak Attack was released on Koch Records. In 2002, he released a gospel-rap album, Spiritual Minded, surprising many longtime fans. Parker had once denounced Christianity as a \"slavemaster religion\" which African-Americans should not follow. He founded the Temple of Hiphop, and released a new album, Kristyles, in mid- 2003, which was preceded by KRS-One: The Mixtape. In the summer of 2004 he released Keep Right.\n\nKRS One\'s latest CD Life, was released in June 2006, and another CD, Adventures in Emceein on Koch Records is slated for later in the year. KRS has also confirmed for his next album of new material, expected to be out in 2007, he will be working with Marley Marl.\n\nSeptember 11 comments and ensuing controversy\n\nIn 2004, KRS engendered a controversy when he was quoted in a panel discussion hosted by New Yorker Magazine as saying that Blacks \"cheered when 911 happened\". The comment drew criticism from many sources, including a pointed barb by the New York Daily News that called Parker an \"anarchist\" and said that \"If Osama bin Laden ever buys a rap album, he\'ll probably start with a CD by KRS-One.\"\n\nParker responded to the furor surrounding his comments with an editorial written for AllHipHop.com. In it, Parker said \"I was asked about why hiphop has not engaged the current situation more (meaning 911), my response was \'because it does not affect us, or at least we don’t perceive that it affects us, 911 happened to them\'. I went on to say that \'I am speaking for the culture now; I am not speaking my personal opinion.\' I continued to say; \'911 affected them down the block; the rich, the powerful those that are oppressing us as a culture. Sony, RCA or BMG, Universal, the radio stations, Clear Channel, Viacom with BET and MTV, those are our oppressors those are the people that we\'re trying to overcome in hiphop everyday, this is a daily thing. We cheered when 911 happened in New York and say that proudly here. Because when we were down at the trade center we were getting hit over the head by cops, told that we can’t come in this building, hustled down to the train station because of the way we dressed and talked, and so on, we were racially profiled. So, when the planes hit the building we were like, \'mmmm, justice\'. And just as I began to say \'now of course a lot of our friends and family were lost there as well\' but I was interrupted...\"',750139,8333723),(985,'LEWO','',1359,7000),(986,'Richie Rich','1.) Set apart by his rapping style and influence on Snoop Doggy Dogg (by Snoop\'s own admission), Richie Rich first entered music in the late \'80s with the Oakland-based group 415. With D-Loc, DJ Darryl, and JED, Rich crafted a Bay Area classic called 41Fivin\', which sold well around the region and spawned a Richie Rich solo album, Don\'t Do It. As the group was ready to sign a major-label contract with Priority in 1990, however, Richie Rich was arrested for possession of cocaine. 415 released its next album and faded from the scene soon after, while Rich sat in jail; he was released a year later, and began appearing on tracks by the Luniz and 2Pac before forming his own label Oakland Hills 41510 and releasing 1/2 Thang. By 1995, Richie Rich had become the first Bay Area rapper to sign with New York\'s Def Jam Records, and his major-label solo debut, Seasoned Veteran, was released in late 1996. This CD had some of his most memorable classics; \"Lets Ride\" and the Tupac tribute \"Do G\'s Get To Go\". The two most famous songs he did with Tupac are; \"Rather be your Nigga\" & \"Aint Hard To Find\" which featured other Bay Area artists.

With an original line-up of founding members Eric \"Lando\" Hagen on guitar/vocals, Jason James/guitar, Mike Bummley/bass and Doug Weldy on drums, the bands live performance delivered a psychadelic early 70s rock vibe that quickly secured a place among the elite stoner bands of the time. Greenhouse Effects first release \"Blast Shield Down\" in 2001, cemented the band as one of the torch bearers of the stonerrock movement in Northern California. Recorded by Thilo Fehlinger at Trident Studios in Pacheco, Ca., the record was done in 5 days with the epic \"Gildor\" recorded live by default. With the release of \"Blast Shield Down\" on Hagen\'s own label Purple Astonaut Records, the album garnered rave reviews being called \"the greatest acid-stoner-space-doom-rock record ever made\" by Sleazegrinder Magazine 2001. The record also made the Stonerrock.com top 20 best albums of 2001. During this time some of the memorable highlights of their live shows were Eric \"Lando\" Hagen\'s Weedstock 2001 shows at the Paradise Lounge in San Francisco, Ca. Those shows which included Acid King, Canyon Creep, Totimoshi, Operator Generator, Gammera and El Buzzard among others would turn into a staging place for co-headliners Greenhouse Effect to unleash their Fuzzed-out sound. With Greenhouse Effects live perormance reputation growing, the band played memorable shows with Keelhaul, Gammera, Natas (Argentina), Bongzilla, Automatic Animal, Brainoil, Jumbos Killcrance, Blessing the Hogs, The Hitch, 16, Skinlab, Sourvein, HDR, Activator, and Spaceboy among others. In 2002 the band performed at Rob Leveys Stoner Hands of Doom IV and delivered a set of music from their yet to be titled second record. A hand shake deal with Jadd from Meteor City Records right after their set would be a quick but short lived success as injuries, line-up changes and other distractions would prevent the as yet to be recorded \"Totalsonicfuzzdom\" from ever being released on Meteor City. With Lando and Jason James the only original members on board and Greg Emmley playing bass, Eric Powers (Clay Wheels) would be recruited to play drums on \"Totalsonicfuzzdom\". With Jeff Pinn engineering, Greenhouse Effect would enter Zilla Studios in South San Francisco to begin recording. With musical and personal differences as well as other distractions surfacing, the fuzzdom sessions ultimately would be cut short with Greg Emmley leaving the band and James starting a band with members of Gammera called Tusk or Soot (The Secret order of Tusk). With an invite to play Stoner Hands of Doom 5 in Portland, Ore looming, Lando finished the loose ends and mastered \"TSF\" @Soundwave Studios in Oakland, Ca. with Jim Juhn. After a short break with Lando involved in other projects and needing to recover from extreme exhaustion both mentally and physically, Greenhouse Effect would ride again. \"Totalsonicfuzzdom\" was released on Purple Astonaut Records in Sept. of 2004. Intact with a new line-up, A cd release show@Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco, Ca. with Chris Corona of Floating Goat on the other guitar would once again bring the band to the forefront. Shows with Clutch, Bottom, Crisis, BRNR, Floating Goat and Hot Black Desiato to name a few would follow. With 2005 on the horizon, and members of the band doing other projects, Lando decided to put Greenhouse Effect on the shelf. Lando would form or join several other projects during this time including Grasshopper, The Centaurs of Divine Disco, Fuzzplow and The Moons of Cronos. Greenhouse Effect would lie dormant until 2006 when an invite to play Stoner Hands of Doom 7 in Mesa, Az. would once again create an opportunity to crank up the fuzzdom... ...... Priest from BRNR would join the band on drums as well as Greg Randolph a bay area musical mastermind on bass. Greenhouse Effect would appear @SHOD 7 and 8. With re-newed energy, Lando and the Effect would then begin work on what would be Greenhouse Effects 3rd studio album \"Ants in the Afterbirth\". The record was recorded @Sonic Room Studios in Livermore, Ca. with Tim Narducci (Spiral Arms, Systematic) engineering. Released in 2007 on Purple Astronaut Records the 4-song EP was dubbed \"more stoner trickery and the best lyrics yet\" by Adam Dunn of Sludgezine. In 2008 Lando again put the band on haitus and formed another stonerrock project called White Witch Canyon with Tim \"Krete\" Narducci on drums and vocals. in 2009 Greenhouse Effect celebrated their 10 year anniversary.

An album made up of Kee, his brother Sidewayz Valentino, and cousin Duke Shiesty, under the group moniker I.T.P.G. Soon after the record was released on the market, word in the industry rapidly grew. Mr. Kee\'s reputation for his dynamic vocal presence coupled with his in-depth story telling abilities, caught the ears of local record labels, and Kee eventually signed with the compilation powerhouse, Black-N-Brown Entertainment, becoming their first and premier solo artist.\n\nHis debut LP, 14 Kt. Dreams, which sound scanned 13,000 units, featured Mr. Kee alongside some of the Bay Area\'s elite, including B-Legit, 11/5, C-Bo and Houston, Texas phenomenon, South Park Mexican. Not one to disappoint, Kee easily outshined every one of his guests, displaying the necessary creative talent, skills, and finesse to establish himself as a significant figure in the Bay Area.\n\nAfter the release of 14 Kt. Dreams, Mr. Kee began to spread like an epidemic appearing on over 60 albums in the Bay Area and Down South. All the while, prepping the nation for Kee to unleash The Latin Plague.\n\nFor his sophomore album, fans found Mr. Kee straying away from the \'typical\' Bay Area album, and big name features on The Latin Plague. Spawning hits like Tequilla Bodyshots, Nasty Mind, Hydro and It\'s On You. Proving he is more than capable and deserving of taking his talent nationwide and joining the illustrious ranks of the few Latin rappers to transcend all boundaries. He next released a few volumes of mixtapes in the year of 2003 called The Doin\' Too Much Mixtapes. In 2004 he came out with another solo called The One. He then dropped the Bay Area 51 Mixtape alongside the Soldiers Of Fortune in 2005. He came with yet another mixtape called the Hennesey Project in 2006 before he dropped his next solo album called The First The Last The Only which was a collaboration with Thizz Nation.\nURLs:	http://www.myspace.com/mrkee\nIn Groups:	Thizz Latin,\nName Variations: Mr. Kee | Mistah KEE\nReleases:\nLivin\' On The Ultimate High (Cass, EP, Art) 		Not On Label 	1993\nFrom The Womb To The Tomb - I.T.P.G (Cass, Album, Ltd, I.T + CD, Album, Ltd, I.T + CD, ) 		Not On Label 	1997\n14 Kt.

Khujo, whose name refers to the leader of the Tribal Maroons who led escaped slaves to freedom. Khujo also means change. If you count the letters K-H-U-J-O on the alphabet, add the numbers up and divide the total by 5, you get the number 13 which symbolizes change:\n\nK(11)+H(8)+U(21)+J(10)+O(15)=65=65/5=13.  Not to mention his birthday falls on the 13th, therefore his name bears special meaning. This change of revolution is evident in the message that Khujo conveys throughout my conversation with him.   The member of the Goodie Mob gets deep with me as I find out how he got his start.  “I like to give the most high praise to Yahweh, the God of Isaac, The God of Abraham, the most high God, I have been in the game professionally since 1994”.  Since elementary school Khujo performed as one of the Pips from Glady\'s Knight & The Pips at Peyton Forest Elementary School talent show. He enjoyed performing in front of an audience and realized his love and talent for music. In middle school, Khujo was a member of a rap group called the \"Party Crashers,\" in which the group would literally \"crash parties.\" It wasn\'t until high school that Khujo began to develop and nurture his lyrical content. \n\n\"In high school, I changed what I rapped about because I was getting older and more mature and things (life) started making sense to me. I began to get conscious about the responsibilities of being a black man, and I wanted to wake my people up. I realized my purpose on earth. God\'s purpose. The P-Funk influence, George Clinton, and the rest helped me to realize what style influenced me.  While in high school, Khujo was a member of a six-person group called \"Six Sense,\" which included Big Gipp and Ray Murray of Organized Noize Productions. Khujo went on to form ‘The Lumberjacks’ along with T-Mo, and from there they met Cee-Lo. The rest is Goodie Mob history!, Big Limb, King Bean, Ceelo,. Rough Rugged and Raw.  Ceelo and Gip came along later.  Goodie Mob which stands for, The Good Die Mostly Over Bullshit, was made by Ceelo.  It meant that good people die over bullshit.  But, as I read more, I find that the wages of sin is death, its really not bullshit.  Its actually sin.”\n\nKhujo, being a member of one of the pioneering groups, that represented the hip hop from the South, is currently set to release his own solo project, simply entitled “Khujo - the Man not the dawg”  The release date is May 28th, and independently distributed.  The album boasts of guest appearances by his brother – Southwest Armstrong, his cousin Mark Twayne, his homeboy, Murda, Slip Matola from the Westside, Whyld Peach, the Children of Israel and fellow Goodie mates,  Big Gipp, and T-Mo.  When asked what separates his material from a typical Goodie Mob album, he responds, Is there a separation from your music or style from the typical Goodie Mob album?  “I have become a lil older, know the game a lil longer, you will get the same stuff you would get from the Goodie Mob but a whole different form.\n\nKhujo, a spiritual, humble, down to earth brother gave me his opinion on the state of the music industry:  “The consumers hear what they want to hear right now, they are calling the radio stations and requesting. It’s almost time for our deliverance out of this world.  That’s why we are not hearing any truths from our leaders, our religious leaders, and definitely the music.  It’s the Program Directors who have the power of what is played.  For the black people who have all the money, let’s get our own radio stations!  Let’s make this change! Some radio stations diving into the payola issue and got people paying $25,000 to get your music played on the radio.  That’s why I want to do the independent thing,  For instance, Houston TX, and the whole area is wide open for independents, it has a wide open market”\n\n \n\nIn the age of technology now music is now being downloaded and some even before the release dates (a new form of bootlegging) do you feel there is a proposed solution for this ?   Khujo confesses that “If you do everything in house, you may slow down the process, but now there are computers and Pro tools, Cakewalk, and other programs, now if you go to the big studios you are letting them cats have ample time to do what they want to do with your product.  I don’t think there is a way to get around it.”\n\nBeing that we focus on good resources and advice for up and coming artists, we had to ask Khujo what his tips were for the aspiring artists.  Khujo’s lends advice for independents and people who feel they have a good marketable product, “In my eyes, if you got a hot song, get you some wax printed up. Then go to a club that is accessible to the type of music you are doing.  Get a relationship with a DJ and then deliver it to them, and let it bubble in the underground, and soon there will be a demand for your product.  Basically its who you know that will get you in there and What you know that will keep you in there.”\n\nCurrently in the advent of the South rising again, the music industry has embraced southern artists and “country” slang and grammar, they feel that the hottest artists at the moment are coming from the south, and therefore are in the process of capitalizing on the marketability, when asking Khujo about this new interest in his home region his response was: “I’ll say we were founders of putting the South on the map, We had role models like Public Enemy, NWA, KRS-One, and then we mad e up our mind of what style we wanted to do, we stuck our neck out on things we believe in, and things like going to the grocery store for you momma, or what state our country is in, or whatever.  In our region before, we talked about shaking booty, or selling dope but we never had any ‘real’ everyday topics that the average person goes through”\n\nKhujo is on the cusp of waking the unrighteous, enlightening the weak, delivering the masses, and delivering those spit fire lyrics as only he knows how in that well known Goodie Format.  His up coming CD, will definitely be a anticipated one, and a much needed refresher in this free thought capitalistic, socially irresponsible music industry.\"\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKhujo (Willie Knighton, Jr.) is an American hip hop musician who was born on March 13, 1972 in Atlanta, Georgia. He is one-fourth of Goodie Mob (along with T-Mo, Cee-Lo, and Big Gipp), and one-half of The Lumberjacks (with T-Mo). Khujo is a very spiritual man known for his distinct, grunty voice and free-flowing rhyming style. He rhymes about all aspects of street life, often intertwining those subject with God metaphorically or directly. In 2002 he was involved in a car crash which resulted in the amputation of his right leg below the knee.\n\nHe released his only solo album, The Man Not The Dawg, in 2002 to limited success. In it he delved into more personal, gritty topics that wouldn\'t have fit in the cohesive, conscious songs in the early Goodie Mob albums.\n\nIn 2008 the first tracks from his forthcoming collaboration with Jneiro Jarel appeared on internet blogs. The tracks, \"Georgiavania\" and \"In The Red\" featured production by Jneiro Jarel and vocals by Jneiro and Khujo. The group is called Willie Isz. The two artists had previously collaborated on the 2008 single \"OPR8R\" by Shape Of Broad Minds. The Willie Isz album \"Georgiavania\" is due to be released on Lex Records in April 2009.\n\nKhujo prefers to be called a messenger as opposed to a rapper, saying, \"\'Cuz rappas wrap gifts.\" He belonged to the Party Crashers rap group in middle school and formed the Six Sense rap group in high school with soon-to-be Dungeon Family affiliates Ray Murray, Big Gipp, and others.\n\nWhile some mistakenly believe that Khujo\'s name is an adaptation of \"Cujo\" the violent dog from the popular Stephen King novel and subsequent film, it is actually a tribute to the leader of the tribal Maroons who lead escaped slaves to freedom.',2311,12430),(1010,'Noah23','Since the early 2000s Guelph, Ontario\'s Noah23 has been building up his reputation of being one of the strangest rappers in the galaxy.

On his latest album Fry Cook On Venus, Noah teams up with Fake Four producers such as Factor, Cars & Trains and Skyrider to make his poppiest and most concentrated effort to date.

He was born in Natchez Mississippi and grew up amongst the influential indie hotbed of Guelph Ontario Canada. He has performed and sold his abstract psychedelic inspired rap records across the world and released over 20 projects and albums.\n\nIn the late 90’s Noah started the highly regarded Plague Language label which released music from a diverse roster of artists including Penny, Orko, Baracuda and also producer Orphan aka Kingston who is now one half of Blue Sky Black Death. Plague Language no longer functions as a label but exists as a loose Royal City based Hip Hop collective.\n\nNoah is currently involved in numerous Plague Language affiliated side projects including Famous PLayaz, Weird Apples, Crunk23 and Bourgeois Cyborgs but is primarily a solo artist signed with American lablel Fake Four.\n\nHe has shared the stage with Kool Keith, Clouddead, Islands, Matisyahu, The Constantines, Plastic Little, Ceschi Ramos, Eternia, Grand Buffet, K-the-I?, Buck 65, Josh Martinez, Modulok & Red Ants, The Saurus, Radioinactive, Shabba D, Awol One, Sole, DJ Scientist, Astronautalis, Cadence Weapon, Krinjah, Shad K, Bus Driver, Swollen Members, Tes, and many more.\n\nPast performance include Barcelona’s SONAR, Low End Theory L.A., Austin’s SXSW, Belgium’s Festival of the Night (DE NACHEN), The OM FESTIVAL, POP Montreal and Guelph’s HILLSIDE Festival.',33071,398962),(1011,'Evren','There are at least two artists with the name Evren.\n\n1. A Canadian rapper and hip-hop artist with several albums (I Think Not (2008), Unknown MC (2004), Conflict of Interest (2002), & Songs From Degrassi: The Next Generation (2005)/Various Artists.\n2. The second artist (with the same stage name) has one known album, Boxes.\n\n\n1. EVREN \n\n\"Music is the way we pray and build a connection with ourselves and the universe.\"  Evren\n\nTurkish-born and Toronto-raised MC Evren, last name Ozdemir, has cultivated a rare talent for making conscious hip hop feel hood savvy over a twenty-year career as a songwriter, producer and composer. Evren’s more than 70 meticulously crafted tracks have appeared on three independent discs: 2002\'s Conflict of Interest, 2004\'s internationally acclaimed Unknown MC and 2008\'s I Think Not. His song writing genius has earned him musical credits on the popular television shows Instant Star, Degrassi - The Next Generation (he co-write the theme song), Billable Hours and The Best Years. He has also earned industry credits for compositions featured in national marketing campaigns by Toyota (including the spontaneous-party-inspiring “Do I Go” 2009 Matrix commercial), TELUS, Nike and Kellogg\'s. His most recent accolade:  A prize at the 2010 Eurovision Song Writing competition for “We Could Be the Same,” performed by Turkish super group maNaga.\n\n	The fourth EP, 2010’S A Little Bit of Love, is much anticipated by the Toronto hip hop community. The album features Evren’s unique soundscape, blending the analogue: Torrie Seager on guitar, Jonny Cooper on bass and Dean Elliot on drums, and the grindy bass back beats, synth tunes and samples characteristic the digital hip hop domain. \n\n	A Little Bit of Love is another compositional feat by Evren, who has an enviable natural ability to organize many layers of seemingly dichotomous sounds, which derive from many different sonic and cultural sources (like Turkish belly dancing tunes and street noise), into a relevant and comprehensible audio masterpiece.\n\n\"I feel this EP is a true reflection of where I am right now musically,” Evren says, “The songs just came so naturally and there\'s a great, relaxed vibe running through the record… I can’t wait to get out and play these songs.”\n\n	A Little Bit of Love also pushes the boundaries between the pop rock and hip hop genres. Fusing Evren\'s ambidextrous lyrical rhetoric and perfectionist rhythmic arrangements of the synth, keyboards, pads and vocals with the sunshine falsetto harmony of Courteney Brooks, Evren\'s musical landscape creates an exciting emotional space that draws you in with its evocative imagery and its innovative blend of unique and authentic sounds. Evren keeps you glued to your iPod because you are compelled to his fiery persona and righteous flow and feel both uplifted and vindicated by his messages. \n\n	Bringing a wealth of personal wisdom from a soul that\'s lived beyond his 32 years, Evren inflects his lyrics with his tenacious spirit and supports his smooth vocals with textured arrangements that rouse you, lull you, hype you, inspire you or encourage you to ‘shine’. Each track is a snapshot of a different fragment of his life, places where he’s been, and with each album he comes a little bit closer to putting the whole story together. \n\n	Evren intelligently expresses a passionate view on topics that reflect the breadth of his maturity as an artist and as a regular guy, with a history, just trying to get by. Anti-establishment, anti-violence and pro-humanity are common themes as he attacks the social stratum, governmental dictates and hip hop ideals that perpetuate violence, blind posturing, commoditization and anti- individuation. He is equally brilliant at ‘bringing the fire’ or inspiring you to reflect and love. \n\n“Music saves me,” Evren confesses, “Writing is my passion… I’m not just the straight hip hop head. I want to be a better person. I’ll keep getting it out there because I enjoy people embracing a message.\"  With the admirable creative genius of his ability to predict, interpret and extend the hip hop industry’s emerging production techniques and an impressive cache of rock solid powerhouse tracks, Evren is what the Toronto hip hop community has been praying for-- and it doesn’t hurt that he looks damn good performing and loves what he does.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/evrenmusic  \nhttp://evrenmusic.com',3178,37052),(1012,'Lost Boyz','The Lost Boyz are a Hip Hop group from South Jamaica, Queens, New York.

The release landed them a record deal with Uptown Records. The group contributed a single to the Don\'t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood soundtrack, titled \"Renee\". The song became a major hit, breaking into the Top 40 on the Hot 100 chart. The single also reached Gold status in 1996. On June 4, 1996, they released their debut album Legal Drug Money. The work was highly acclaimed, and the album featured five Billboard Hot 100 hits, including their past singles \"Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless\", \"Renee\", as well as \"Music Makes Me High\", \"Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz & Benz\" and \"Get Up\". The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1996. Their second album, Love, Peace & Nappiness, was released on June 17, 1997 on Uptown/Universal Records. It featured another Hot 100 hit single, \"Me & My Crazy World\". One of the most famous songs on the album was the posse-cut \"Beasts From The East\", featuring A+, Redman and Canibus. The album wasn\'t as acclaimed as their debut, but fared well commercially, reaching Gold status in late 1997.\n\nLost Boyz called it a day in \'99. On the night of March 28, 1999, at a birthday party for Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tah was shot in the head while exiting the Sheraton Hotel in Queens. Tah was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 4:20 am, at the age of 27. The getaway driver, Raheem Fletcher, was sentenced to 7 years in prison for Manslaughter. In 2001, Kelvin Jones pleaded guilty to the murder. The three remaining group members finished their third album LB IV Life, released in September 1999. The effort fell short critically and commercially, failing to provide any Hot 100 hits, and failing to reach Gold status. The three split-up after the release, and lead MC Mr. Cheeks began a solo career. He released his first solo effort John P. Kelly in 2001, which featured the smash hit \"Lights, Camera, Action!\". The album also featured a heartfelt tribute song to Freaky Tah, titled \"Till We Meet Again\", featuring Bob Marley\'s son Stephen.

Consisting of two veteran MCs and a DJ, the Dodgers have been gaining recognition throughout the Midwest for years. By incorporating several different genres of music into their production, and mixing complex lyrics with innovative deliveries, they have created their own unique style of Hip-Hop.\nThe founding members Brady \"B.Gozza\" Gasser and Rex \"Jackpot\" Demski began recording and performing in the early nineties. In 1994 they collaborated with other local rappers and producer Phizyx to release a successful single under the collective name \"The Juggernaut\". Enjoying success at retail and receiving critical acclaim, the group toured the Midwest until disbanding in 1996. Shortly after, B.Gozza and Jackpot began working again as the Artfull Dodgers. In 1997 they released the EP entitled \"Dusted World\", with Phizyx returning on the production. The Dodgers wasted no time and started performing again throughout Michigan.\n\nFrom 1998-1999 the Dodgers completed their first full-length album, \"Lazy Eyes\". Collaborating with well-established producer Pharlon \"Bangtown\" Randle, the 12 song LP was a creative masterpiece that spoke out to the global Hip-Hop scene. The album received critical acclaim and opened many doors for the Dodgers. The single \"One Mic Then Pass\", quickly became an underground classic throughout the Midwest. The song also became the Dodgers\' first music video, and received steady rotation on many independent video shows. The Dodgers continued to perform all over the Midwest in clubs and arenas, and have shared the stage with such industry heavyweights as Killah Priest and Cappadonna of the Wu Tang Clan, Too Short, Petey Pablo, and Eminem as well as headlining many of their own shows.\n\n2001 was an exceptional year for the Dodgers. After picking up a pressing and distribution deal through Chicago\'s Aeemp Records, they released a new single called \"Laced\" and began working on their sophomore album. The Dodgers also added a new member to their roster this year, Jake \"DJ Sir Real\" Greba, formerly of Detroit\'s Howling Diablos. Sir Real had previous experience working with the Dodgers and became a powerful addition to the group. The Dodgers traveled the country touring, and recorded the new album in various studios with multiple producers to accomodate the experimental feel of the album.\n\nIn 2002 the sophomore album \"Second Wind\" was unleashed. The 22-song LP was an achievement, and elevated the Dodgers into the underground elite. Collaborating with a variety of talented producers and the likes of Killah Priest and underground legend J.U.I.C.E, the album secured the Dodgers spot among the most promising of independent Hip-Hop artists. \"Second Wind\" and the lead single \"Still Writing Rhymes\" quickly became classics in the Midwest. Success on College radio and astounding critical praise continues to elevate the album. \"Second Wind\" even received the prestigious \"Album of the Year Award\" from Detroitrap.com at their Hip-Hop Awards Show.\n\nIn 2004 the Dodgers went on the road with the Vans Warped Tour performing on the Code Of Tha Cutz Stage. The tour was a huge success with record setting attendance at the Detroit stop. More tours are in the works as well as the Dodgers debut in Europe. A second Artfull Dodgers\' film is currently in production.\n\nIn 2006 the Dodgers completed \"Off The Credenza\", their most artistic and complex album yet. The album was picked up by Silent Records out of Detroit Michigan and is set to be released on September 11, 2007. 2006 also marked yet another change in the Dodgers\' roster with DJ Sir Real leaving the group to pursue a career as a solo DJ.

Their music falls loosely under the heading of \"pop\" but is really a unique blend of many musical styles such as rock, folk, latin, country and swing. The music is very upbeat, saturated with extremely catchy hooks and lyrics that often tell stories with a decidedly \"tongue in cheek\" flare. At times it sounds a little \"retro\" but at others much more contemporary. Groups that have been influential to their style are Barenaked Ladies, Dave Matthews, XTC, The Beatles, Crowded House, They Might Be Giants and Elvis Costello, just to name a few. Their music\'s energy seems to jump right off their CDs as you play them. You\'re gonna want to use this in place of any of those antidepressants you\'ve been taking! THIS music is the antidote to all of that dark, angst ridden, brooding and whiney music you will find out there today without becoming overly sentimental or sappy. MADHOUSE is just plain FUN!!! The band\'s live shows are quite a spectacle to behold, with loads of antics, props and peculiar dance moves. These guys are not just musicians...they are entertainers! The music is delivered with energy and musicianship to spare, and the audience is always made to feel they are part of the show.',391,7061),(1022,'Resin Dogs','Resin Dogs are a hip hop band from Brisbane, Queensland that formed in 1996.\n\nThe name Resin Dogs is synonymous with massive energy, huge crowds and an infectious rollcall of rhythms. Continually redefining themselves through their frenetic touring schedule, while stamping their name on acclaimed singles and two full length albums, Resin Dogs are established as one of Australia’s most successful bands of recent times.\n\nFrom humble beginnings in 1996, the teaming of DJ Katch, Geoff (Jigsaw) Boardman, Dave Atkins and Chris Bosley quickly proved a unique formula. Crowds grew and continued to swell with their early shows at Ric’s and The Zoo, in Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley, establishing the band’s unquestionable credentials. The sound - an undeniably hot blending of cut and paste sampling, funk, hip hop, breakbeat, and frenetic live playing.\n\nThey quickly attracted label attention as venues filled and their first independent releases were snapped up by punters in huge numbers across Australia. In 2000 they signed with Virgin/ EMI for their debut album release in a dual deal along with their own label Hydrofunk. A force in its own right, Hydrofunk is the established base for the many Resin Dogs side projects and responsible for releasing the band’s 2003 follow up full length Hi Fidelity Dirt.\n\nThe band’s two albums Grand Theft Audio and Hi Fidelity Dirt continue to attract strong sales and widespread praise from critics and fans. Vinyl sales of Grand Theft Audio grow every year as it becomes a favourite of DJs across the globe.\n\nThe Resin Dogs line up doesn\'t stop with its four core members. There are a number of co-conspirators who join the band for their live events and studio sessions. MC DNO (Shin Ki Row, Decipher), percussionist Peter Neville (Trout fishing In Quebec), and an impressive line up of guest breakers, MC’s and live players make any Resin Dogs show ‘an experience’ and their recordings so highly prized.\n\nResin Dogs scooped three Australian Dance Music Awards - Best Hip Hop Act 2001 and Best Live Act back to back 2002 and 2003. In 2004 the band was Ambassador of the largest celebration on Australia’s youth calendar - National Youth Week.\n\nResin Dogs have blitzed every major Australian festival year after year. Testament to the popularity and sheer talent of the band Resin Dogs have played Livid, Meredith, Woodford and Blues & Roots Music Festivals (to name just a few) and in a huge feat Big Day Out for seven years. Organisers of Meredith Music Festival said of Resin Dogs performance “…the best 90 minutes of live groove ever seen in the bush”.\n\nThe band’s collaborations and recordings feature the very best that Australia, and the world has to offer. Too many to list, the highlights would have to include the likes of DJ Ransom, Ben Ely (Regurgitator), Abstract Rude (Abstract Tribe Unique), Lazy Grey, Robert Reed (Trouble Funk), Mad Doctor X, Kenny Dope, Super Dense Child and most recently The Pharcyde, Jungle Brothers and the immense talents of the UK’s Spikey Tee. An invitation from Black Eyed Peas saw Resin Dogs support the band on their Australian tour in October 2004.\n\nA triumphant appearance at the world’s largest WOMAD Festival at Rivermead in England and a sell-out show at London’s favourite club Cargo, which has seen many of the world’s finest DJs, signals the start of the push to play internationally for the band.\n\nHaving performed sell-out concerts across Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the UK, Resin Dogs are focused on showing the world the best that Australia has to offer. Already set to be a huge year internationally 2005 will see Resin Dogs tour the UK twice, perform in Europe in August (including the massive Sziegt Festival, Hungary) and in September will be performing and recording in London and Los Angeles.',13037,98223),(1023,'DJ Supreme','',7138,37766),(1024,'Bz Jam','',46,172),(1025,'Kardinal Offishall','Kardinal Offishall (born Jason Harrow on May 21, 1976 in Scarborough, Ontario) is a Canadian hip-hop MC and producer of Jamaican descent.Kardinal is often viewed as \"Canada\'s hip-hop ambassador\", and along with MC\'s such as Saukrates and Maestro Fresh Wes, he\'s arguably the most popular. Kardinal blends soul, dancehall, reggae and hip-hop to create a truly unique sound.\n\nKardinal started rapping at the age of eight, and was winning competitions by the time he was 12. Also at the age of 12, Kardinal performed live and on stage for the first time, with Nelson Mandela in attendance during his first visit to Toronto.[2] By 1993, he decided to drop his alias \"KoolAid\", and went by the moniker Kardinal Offishall after being inspired by the great 17th century French politician Cardinal Richelieu.\n\nKardinal was signed to a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music Canada at the age of 20. In 1996, he released his first single \"Naughty Dread\", which was featured on the Rap Essentials Volume One compilation and earned him a Juno Award nomination for Best Rap Recording. In 1997, Kardinal released his debut album Eye & I on Capitol Hill Music. The only single from the album, \"On Wit Da Show\", had considerable video play on MuchMusic. Kardinal was also credited as a major contributor to the late 90\'s renaissance of Canadian hip hop. In 1998, he was featured on the Juno-winning single \"Northern Touch\" with the Rascalz, Choclair, Checkmate and Thrust.\n\nIn 2000, Kardinal signed with MCA Records. He released the album Quest for Fire: Firestarter, Vol. 1 in 2001, which spawned the hits \"BaKardi Slang\" and \"Ol\' Time Killin\'\". The album earned a gold certification in Canada. After MCA folded in 2003, Kardinal\'s highly anticipated follow up album Firestarter Vol. 2: F Word Theory was shelved along with the single/video for \"Belly Dancer\" featuring Pharrell, and Kardinal eventually found himself without a label. Had the album been released, there would have been production from Timbaland and The Neptunes among others. He released an independent mixtape titled Kill Bloodclott Bill in 2004 with his production company, The Black Jays, and he also released his second major-label album titled Fire and Glory in 2005, through Virgin Records in Canada only. Hits on Fire and Glory include \"Everyday (Rudebwoy)\" and \"Heads Up\".\n\nKardinal has also produced many songs, including the hit single \"Let\'s Ride\" by Choclair, whose album Ice Cold went gold in 35 days and would win them a Juno in 2000. However, it was with the Black Jays team when Kardinal received notoriety for his production work. In 2004, Kardinal and Solitair of the Black Jays created a remix version of Jay-Z\'s The Black Album and called it The Black Jays Album. Kardinal also did some production on Kill Bloodcott Bill and produced 9.5 out of the 14 tracks on Fire and Glory.\n\nHe is one of the few Canadian hip hop artists that have an international audience and has collaborated with artists such as Busta Rhymes, Method Man, Sean Paul, Spragga Benz, Bounty Killer, Little Brother, Stat Quo, Pharoahe Monch, Vybz Kartel, Rihanna, Snow, Pete Rock, Lil Wayne and Akon. A-List producers, The Neptunes requested Kardinal appear on the remix to their smash hit production “Grindin\'” with Clipse. The remix was well received across North America, particularly in New York City.\n\nTo date, Kardinal is the only Canadian urban act to appear on BET’s Rap City (even freestyling in the booth with Big Tigger), and on MTV’s Advance Warning (which introduces the world to artists on the verge of breaking big, like former guest Kanye West). Kardinal has made brief guest appearances in Rihanna\'s \"Pon De Replay\" music video, and Sean Paul\'s \"Get Busy\" video, which was shot in Woodbridge, Ontario (a Toronto suburb). He has also appeared on mixtapes from Clinton Sparks and DJ Green Lantern.\n\nIn 2006, Kardinal collaborated Akon, Cipha Sounds, DJ Whoo Kid, and various members of the Black Jays family among others. At the 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards, Kardinal walked away with 3 awards for \"Everyday (Rudebwoy)\", including Best Video, Best Director (RT!) and VideoFACT Award.

Francis uses a broad emotional palette to address a wide range of personal, cultural, and political issues. His unconventional style and persona have given him crossover appeal, but at the same time alienated some hip-hop listeners. \n\nPrior to embarking on a full-time career as an MC, Francis displayed his skills in slam poetry. During the late 1990s, he recorded his first demo tape (1996), fronted the now defunct Providence hip-hop band Art Official Intelligence, and hosted a weekly slot on independent radio station WRIU (the \"True School Session\"). He also formed the Non-Prophets and released a 12” (Drop Bass/Bounce/I Keep Calling, Emerge Records, 1999), following up in 2003 with their first full-length offering, Hope.

He is also loosely affiliated with the vague underground hip-hop super-group The Orphanage.\n\nAs a solo performer, Francis won the MC battle at the 2000 Scribble Jam, and in 2001 he came close to repeating as champion (semi-finalist) while performing as his \"metal\" alter ego, \"Xaul Zan\". Francis released his first proper solo album, Personal Journals, on Anticon. in 2002. He toured with a live band on the Live Band Dead Poet Tour to support it.

His first album for Epitaph, A Healthy Distrust, was released in early 2005 and was followed up with Human the Death Dance in 2007.\n\nOne of Francis\' best-known tracks is \"Makeshift Patriot\", a commentary on the American media recorded one month after the September 11, 2001 attacks which he released on the internet as an MP3 as well as a limited edition 7\" single.\n\nIn February 2005 Sage dropped his second full length album on the originally punk label Epitaph, it was widely regarded as the best underground hip hop album of the year by critics and fans alike and featured heavily political tracks such as \"The Buzz Kill\" and \"Slow Down Gandhi\" and more personal material like that more similar to that of his debut \'Personal Journals\' such as \'Bridle\' and a few heavily satirical comments on the modern day rap and urban scene such as the satirical comment on youth gun culture \'Gunz Yo\'.\n\nSage has helped to set up the Wiki KnowMore.org which is described as a \'way to keep tabs on the some of the biggest and most dangerous businesses in the world\'. He is a vegetarian and also chooses to abstain from drugs and drinking, though doesn\'t label himself as \"straight-edge\" because he believes \"you shouldn\'t define yourself by what you don\'t do.\" \n\nSage has set up his own label and signed some of who he claims to be his favorite artists of the moment such as Buck 65 and Proplyphic and Reanimator named Strange Famous (which shares his initials) with which he released his most recent work \'Human the Death Dance\'\n\nThis album was released in May 2007 and takes a step away from the heavily political \'Healthy Distrust\' and heads back to the more personal lyrics of \'Personal Journals\' and comments on modern culture. The album features cameos from many Strange Famous artists such as Buddy Wakefield, Buck 65 and Reanimator.\n\nIn 2010 Sage released his fourth full length album Li(f)e (the title coming from the famous quote from \'The Cure\' on the Non-Prophets album Hope \"Life is just a lie with an f in it and death is definite\").

So Haystak took a daring chance and joined a local label called Street Flava Records and producers Kevin Grisham and Sonny Paradise. They produced his debut album, Mak Million, in 1998. With his description of the southern way of life from a white boy\'s point of view, Haystak won the respect of his peers in the underground rap scene and was recognized by the people of Nashville, both white and black. Two years later, Car Fulla White Boys came out with many fans waiting eagerly. With his success, Koch Records signed Haystak and rereleased Car Fulla White Boys that same year.

They played some shows, recorded an EP (Dear Light Outside, released on Lockjaw records) and later two other tracks, one of which (Weight and Carriage) found its way onto the BSM 6machine compilation. In Autumn \'08 they brought another member into the fold, and decided a change was needed. They are interested in history. They are interested in the Rosenbergs. It sort of made sense. They can now be found under the name On Histories of Rosenberg. Their first EP is due out August 09.\n\n2) A trio from San Francisco that consisted of guitar, bass, drums, and vocals, Caesura played unique, scattershot rock, the spirit of which is lodged firmly in the punk rock tradition of bands such as Mission of Burma, Gang of Four, and the Minutemen. Caesura worked diligently during its existence to solidify its sound, which has emerged as tight, slashing and bass-driven, with strong, confident vocals.\nBrad Purvis - Bass\nEvan Rehill - Guitar, voice\nMike Shoun - Drums\n\n3) Caesura are a young Exeter (South West England) based Metal band with influences from all areas of the mighty Metal Genre! Fusing groovy drum beats and bass-lines with catchy, yet still crushingly heavy, guitar riffs and brutal vocals. Caesura started out in July 2009 with Ed (Vocals), Damo (Guitar) and Jack (Guitar) and began writing material , Andy (Bass) and Toby (Drums) were quickly recruited and thus Caesura was complete.\nCaesura played their first gig on 17th May 2010 at Exeter Cavern. And continued to gig around the local area with some great bands and a metal hungry crowd. After putting on many energetic shows, making sure the crowd gets involved, The ball has started to roll after six months of gigging around Devon.\nIn April 2011 Caesura parted with Jack and Toby and the positions were filled by Gary (Drums) and Alex (Guitar).

While Nilla Pizzi was the Queen.\nBut the baby-boomer generation disliked more  and more his genre, style  and virtuosisms (the long acute Grand Finale - e.g., notable in “Granada” -, bringing a stereotype operatic flavour into traditional pop or easy listening “musica leggera”).  Sharp age divisions therefore emerged, so as to make music tastes become an  identitarian, Weltanschaung space of generational divide, at the time of  ‘50s rock (with Little Tony, Italy’s Elvis), then the ‘60s new pop (many thousands of cave bands, also in Italy). All this was not so specially Italian, of course; but, because of his so long career, Claudio became a target symbol (for the ritual “parricide”); he was gradually ghettoed into an ageing but always faithful audience (no empty space at his concerts). On the other hand, he basically sticked to his 1950s repertoire and style.\nTogether with Domenico Modugno, he holds the record for the most wins at the Sanremo Music Festival, where he won the competition in 1955 (Buongiorno tristezza), 1957 (Corde della mia chitarra), 1962 (Addio ... addio) and 1967 (Non pensare a me). He won the RAI-TV Canzonissima competition in 1964 with \" ‘O sole mio\", and in 1966 with \"Granada\".\nHis debut was as a follower of the folk singer Carlo Buti (Florence 1902-1963, “the Golden Voice of Italy”); in 1947 he records his first 78 giri record (a rarity now) and in 1952 he is the main actor in the movie “Serenata amara” dir. by Pino Mercanti - followed by about 30 movies, where he is often singing as well; he most loved the Mario Valli character, an artist in “Granada Addio” (1966) dir. by Marino Girolami.\nIn the 1950s, together with his archi-rival Luciano Tajoli, he interpreted even many songs that will almost disappear afterward: \"Il Ponte\", \"La luna nel rio\" (Who threw the moon in the river, who threw it ...) and  \"Fontane Romane\". Among Claudio Villa’s classics, one shoud also mention: 1948 Scalinatella, 1949 Fontana di Trevi  and Signorinella, 1950 Luna Rossa, the 1951 Neapolitan suite (Voce \'e notte - Core \'ngrato - \'Na sera \'e maggio - Anema e core -  Malafemmena -  Munasterio \'e Santa Chiara - Marechiaro), 1951 I’ te vurria vasà, 1952 Vola colomba and Vecchio scarpone, 1955 Arrivederci Roma, 1956 Guaglione, 1957 Corde della mia chitarra, Lazzarella, La vie en rose, and Ave Maria di Schubert, 1958 Nel blu dipinto di blu (Modugno’s Volare), 1960 Romantica and Marina, 1969 Strangers in the night, 1974 Michelle and La Paloma, 1980 Dove sta Zazà and Tamurriata nera, 1982 El Condor pasa,  1985 Nessun dorma, and Caro amore (Concerto per Aranjuez).\nIn 1973 he interprets unforgettably  on TV some “stornelli a dispetto” in duet with the great folksinger Gabriella Ferri, his great admirer and friend. After different labels, he ended up recording with Cetra (later on becoming Fonit-Cetra).\nHis death in 1987 by heart attack was announced live on Italian television by Pippo Baudo, during the last night of the Sanremo Music Festival of 1987.\nHe recorded across 4 decades over 3000 songs, and sold over 45 million records.',39061,236303),(1081,'Anika Horvat','',694,5588),(1082,'Edda Heiðrún Backman','Icelandic singer and artist.',1323,18703),(1083,'The Mong Cowboy','',14,81),(1084,'Pérez Prado','Pérez Prado (Dámaso Pérez Prado, December 11, 1916 – September 14, 1989) was a Cuban bandleader, musician (singer, organist and pianist), and composer. He is often referred to as the \"King of the Mambo\".\n\nPérez was actually his surname, he became known by the paternal and maternal surnames \"Pérez Prado.\"\nHis orchestra was the most popular in mambo. His son, Pérez Prado, Jr., continues to direct the Pérez Prado Orchestra in Mexico City to this day.\nPerez was born in Matanzas, Cuba, his mother Sara Prado was a school teacher, his father Pablo Pérez a journalist at El Heraldo de Cuba. He studied classical piano in his early childhood, and later played organ and piano in local clubs. For a time, he was pianist and arranger for the Sonora Matancera, Cuba\'s best-known musical group. He also worked with casino orchestras in Havana for most of the 1940s, and gained a reputation for being an imaginative (his solo playing style predated bebop by at least five years), loud player. He was nicknamed \"El Cara de Foca\" (\"Seal Face\") by his peers at the time.\nIn 1948 he moved to Mexico to form his own band and record for RCA Victor. He quickly specialized in mambos, an upbeat adaptation of the Cuban danzón. Perez\'s mambos stood out among the competition, with their fiery brass riffs and strong saxophone counterpoints, and most of all, Pérez\'s trademark grunts (he actually says \"¡Dilo!\", or \"Say it!\", in many of the perceived grunts). In 1950 arranger Sonny Burke heard \"Que rico el mambo\" while on vacation in Mexico and recorded it back in the United States as \"Mambo Jambo\". The single was a hit, which caused Perez to launch a US tour. His appearances in 1951 were sell-outs and he began recording US releases for RCA Victor.\n\nPerez is the composer of such famous pieces as \"Mambo No. 5\"  and \"Mambo No. 8\". At the height of the mambo movement, in 1955, Perez hit the American charts at number one with a cha-cha version of \"Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White\" (composed by French composer Louiguy). This arrangement, featuring trumpeter Billy Regis, held the spot for 10 consecutive weeks. The song also went to number one in the UK and in Germany. Perez had first covered this title for the movie Underwater! in 1954, where Jane Russell can be seen dancing to \"Cherry Pink\". In 1958 one of Perez\'s own compositions, \"Patricia\", became the last record to ascend to #1 on the Jockeys and Top 100 charts, both of which gave way the following week to the then newly-introduced Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song also went to number one in Germany, and in the UK it reached number eight.\n\nHis popularity in the United States matched the peak of the first wave of interest in Latin music outside the Latino communities during the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s.[7][8] He also performed in films in the United States and Europe, as well as in Mexican cinema (Rumberas film), always with his trademark goatee and turtle-neck sweaters and vests. With the end of the 1950s, his success waned, and the years gave way to new rhythms, like rock \'n roll and then pop music. His association with RCA Victor ended in the 1960s, and his recorded output was mainly limited to smaller labels and recycled Latin-style anthologies. In the United States he was referred to as \"Prez\" Prado.\n[edit]Later life\nIn the early 1970s Perez permanently returned to his apartment off Mexico City\'s grand Paseo de la Reforma to live with his wife and two children, son Dámaso Pérez Salinas (known as Perez Prado, Jr.) and daughter María Engracia. His career in Latin America was still strong. He toured and continued to record material which was released in Mexico, South America, and Japan. He was revered as one of the reigning giants of the music industry and was a regular performer on Mexican television. In Japan, a live concert recording of his 1973 tour was released on LP in an early 4-channel format known as Quadraphonic.\nIn 1981 Perez was featured in a musical revue entitled Sun which enjoyed a long run in the Mexican capital. In 1983 his brother Pantaleón Pérez Prado died, and the press erroneously reported the death of bandleader Pérez Prado.[citation needed] His last United States appearance was in Hollywood on September 12, 1987, when he played to a packed house. This was also the year of his last recording. Persistent ill health plagued him for the next two years, and he died of a stroke in Mexico City on September 14, 1989, aged 72.\n\nDuring his lifetime, a cast of musical luminaries passed through his orchestra, including:\nAlex Acuña, percussion\nPete Candoli, trumpet\nBeny Moré, vocals\nJohnny Pacheco, percussion [later flute]\nArmando Peraza, percussion\nMongo Santamaría, percussion\n\n\n\"Patricia\" was later featured in\nthe striptease scene in Federico Fellini\'s 1960 film La Dolce Vita\nbackground music for a pool party in the 1969 film Goodbye, Columbus\nthe episode \"Some Enchanted Evening\" of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, first aired on May 13, 1990.\na long-running series of famous TV commercials for the Royal Mail in the UK (using the slogan \"I Saw This and Thought of You\") between 1996 and 2003\nthe closing credits of HBO\'s Real Sex series\nthe 2000 Clint Eastwood movie Space Cowboys\nHis mambo records and the joyous dancing they caused are described in a late chapter of Jack Kerouac\'s seminal novel, On the Road (1957).\nHis songs \"Caballo Negro\", \"Lupita\", and \"Mambo n.8\" are featured in the film Santa Sangre (1989) by Alejandro Jodorowsky.\nHis recording of \"Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)\" features in the films Deal of the Century (1983), Cookie (1989) and Parents (1989).\nIn the decade after his death, the popularity of Perez\'s music was on the rise again. CD reissues of his RCA recordings continue to sell steadily. \"Guaglione\" peaked at number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in 1995,[6] following its use in the Guinness television commercial Anticipation.\n \"Mambo No. 5\" was featured in another Guinness commercial in 1999, the same year Lou Bega took his sampled cover version of that same song to the top of the UK chart, \nThe soundtrack to the 1999 movie Office Space features two of his performances, \"Mambo No. 8\" and \"The Peanut Vendor.\"\nThe soundtrack to the 2004 movie Diarios de Motocicleta features Perez\'s \"Qué rico el mambo\", more commonly known as \"Mambo Jambo\".\nAvant-garde musician Nurse With Wound released a compilation entitled Funeral Music for Perez Prado in 2001.

At that time no one could have imagined that his voice would one day become the most perfect expression of the word “love”.\n\nAny attempt to analyse  the “Parios Phenomenon”, his enormous appeal to the public and the hundreds of thousands of record sales (all his releases have won both gold and platinum discs), will show that his success is the result of his constant search for lyrics and music which contribute to his own growth as an artist, which promote his art and which will stand the test of time.  Most of Yannis Parios’ time is spent on his work, which he approaches with dedication and respect.\n\nHis great talent, then, in conjunction with these factors explains why Parios has managed to break new ground in the love song, to gain the recognition of the general public and to have his songs on everyone’s lips.  His popularity is constantly increasing and Parios is one of the very few singers who does not need a constant string of hit recordings to maintain his fame.\n\n“Whenever a song is born”, says Yannis Parios - and this is one of his most deep-seated beliefs - ”and wherever it is sung (in France, Italy, or anywhere else), it belongs to everyone.  That, really, is the reason why music exists:  so that it cannot be fenced in by frontiers”.\n\nWith that consideration in mind, Yannis Parios was the first Greek singer to perform Alain Barriere’s song “Tu t’en vas” with Greek lyrics.  Under its new title “Tora pia”; the song was a gigantic hit, on an unprecedented scale for the time, and it marked the beginning of a new age in which many Greek singers adapted “foreign” melodies to Greek lyrics.\n\nYannis Parios has worked with many of the leading Greek composers, including Greek composers, including Manos Loizos, Yorgos Hadzinasios, Stavros Xarchakos, Stamatis Spanoudakis, Yorgos Katsaros, Marios Tokas, Yannis Spanos and Alaxis Papadimitriou.  He writes lyrics of his own, and often composes music, too.  Quite a number of his songs have been translated and sung abroad.  One of his releases holds the record for Greek sales:  this was the album “Nisiotika”, released in 1982 and consisting of a collection of songs of the Aegean islands which, as an islander himself, he learnt and first sang in childhood.\n\nYannis Parios does not confine his appearances to Greece:  he has sung at the Albert Hall, the Carnegie Hall and the largest theatres in Canada and Australia.

Trei ani mai târziu a câștigat acest concurs cu maximum de puncte. Succesele s-au ținut apoi lanț. Referent de specialitate la Centrul Creației Populare Bistrița, culegătoare de folclor, îndrumătoare a copiilor care doresc să-i pășească pe urme, Valeria Peter Predescu a strâns în cei 35 de ani de carieră, 61 de albume, patru cărți și culegeri folclorice, diplome, titluri onorifice și premii primite în țară și la diverse festivaluri folclorice internaționale. În anul 1994 a fost laureată a premiului „Ethnos” pentru activitatea sa de culegătoare și interpretă a folclorului năsăudean. În 1974 i-a apărut primul disc mic la Electrecord cu cinci dintre cele șase cântece pe care le-a înregistrat la Radio. Un an mai tarziu a fost invitată la Casa Electrecord de către directorul Teodor Cartiș și a editat al doilea disc mic. După doi ani i-a apărut un LP mare cu douăsprezece cântece, intitulat \"Ia-mă în brațe, dorule\",care s-a bucurat de o foarte bună primire din partea publicului. Apoi a făcut și alte înregistrări la diferite case de producție. Are înregistrate trei CD-uri cu pricesne, două cu colinde, altele cu cântări de dragoste și de dor. Are înregistrat un CD \"Mândre-s nunțile la noi\" cu folclor din ceremonialul de nuntă năsăudeană și, de asemenea, are în repertoriu și balade. Repertoriul Valeriei Peter Predescu este năsăudean, dar cuprinde cântece și din alte zone ale județului Bistrița-Năsăud, cel mai mult însă de pe Valea Sălăuței, de unde este ea, și de pe Valea Someșului.

În paginile cărții sunt prezentate viața și activitatea Valeriei Peter Predescu, dar mai ales colaborarea sa cu ansamblurile folclorice din județ, turneele peste hotare, succesele și premiile obținute. Acum este catedra de muzica din comuna sa, în Telciu. Are șase clase cu copii foarte talentați și a pus bazele unui grup folcloric foarte numeros alcătuit din 54 de copii din comună. În paralel cu activitatea sa la catedră a fost invitată de un post de televiziune local să realizeze o emisiune intitulată \"Artă și tradiție\". Aduce în fața telespectatorilor oameni din lumea satului, meșteri populari, rapsozi, oameni care au ceva de spus, care scriu versuri populare sau care au preocupări privind tradițiile. Apoi, în Bistrița se ocupă de un alt grup folcloric intitulat \"Miorița\", alcătuit din aproape 30 de copii, dar aceștia sunt și din alte localități ale județului.

După pierderile suferite a început să fie preocupată de versuri și cântări de înmormântare, gen oarecum neglijat în lucrările de specialitate. Atunci a adunat versurile pe care le făcea diacul dintr-o localitate sau o femeie sau un bărbat cu har, versuri individualizate pentru omul care pleca din această lume. A făcut și un set de fotografii la diferite întâmplări triste din viața omului. A editat cartea intitulată \"Cântarea de pe urmă\" cu cele insoțitoare ale omului. Cartea are si un compact disc cu vocile femeilor care cântau, care boceau morții. A înregistrat aceste cântări începând din 1973 până în 2005. Cartea este prefațată de profesorul universitar dr.

Σταθμός στη ζωή του ο χαμός των γονέων του, κάτι το οποίο τον ανάγκασε να μείνει μόνος του ανάμεσα σε τρεις αδερφές σε πολύ τρυφερή ηλικία. \n\nΣυγκυρίες οι οποίες ανάγκασαν τον Ζαφείρη, να μάχεται, να παλεύει, και να αγωνίζεται στη ζωή από μικρός.

Along with a successful recording career in the 1960s, Hill hosted several hit UK TV shows during the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nHill first sang professionally in a public house called The Prospect in Margate, Kent, when he was seventeen years old. He did not become a full-time musician after he had worked as baker, truck driver and coal miner. His first lucky break as a singer came when he read an advert in the \'Melody Maker\' magazine, which said The Band of the Royal Corps Of Signals needed a vocalist. After completing his military service, he toured with the musical \'Florodora\', and he then became a singer with Teddy Foster\'s Band, a big band based in London. At the beginning of the 1960s, Hill joined the critically acclaimed British vocal group, The Raindrops, which gave him his first opportunity to perform in television and radio shows, especially on the BBC radio show \'Parade of the Pops\'. \n\nBy late 1961, Hill left The Raindrops for a fledgling solo career. His debut entry in the UK Singles Chart was the Vandyke penned \'The River\'s Run Dry\', which went to No. 41 in June 1962. In January 1965, Hill was offered an international recording contract with the EMI group, which signed him to their Columbia label. His first Top 20 chart success with his new label came a year later with \'Take Me To Your Heart Again\', Hill\'s cover of the Édith Piaf hit, \'La Vie En Rose\', which climbed to no. 13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1966. His most successful hit was his cover recording of the Rodgers and Hammerstein song \'Edelweiss\', from their 1959 musical \'The Sound of Music\'. The recording was a no. 2 hit in the UK Singles Chart in March 1967. It was to become his signature tune for the rest of his career,\n\nHill\'s long-term recording contract with EMI Columbia came to an end in 1974, by which time he had released 14 studio albums and countless singles. The following year, Hill signed a new recording deal with CBS Records, for whom he released a further three studio albums of contemporary song material. Hill hosted several hit UK TV shows during the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, Hill concentrated mainly on his live performances.

Flint and Dewey had been in school bands together, and when the two moved to London in the autumn of 1990 met Brown who completed the line-up.\nThe band, after attracting attention from several record labels, signed to the Virgin records subsidiary Hut Records in the summer of 1991. The band quickly picked up a following, supporting the likes of Chapterhouse, Slowdive, Teenage Fanclub and Blur, and gained a lot of press coverage, most notably in NME, Melody Maker and The Face. Their first single, \"Heaven Sent An Angel\" topped the UK independent charts, as did the follow-up \"Crimson\", and the third single \"Venice\". The band specialised in bright, abrasive guitar-pop songs with strong melodies, and were determined (but ultimately failed) to distinguish themselves from the other guitar bands of the era. The UK press lumped them in with the shoegazer movement, a tag that the band weren\'t comfortable with.\nA compilation of these first 3 singles was released in the States as \"Baby\'s Angry\" on Caroline Records, and gained the band airplay on US college radio. The band toured America in the autumn of 1992, on a co-headlining tour with fellow Caroline Records act Drop Nineteens.\nIn 1993, Revolver released the single \"Cradle Snatch\", closely followed by the album \"Cold Water Flat\", and while the songs were more sophisticated than their earlier work, the sales weren\'t as impressive, and Virgin dropped the band after a final single \"I Wear Your Chain\" failed to make the top 75. The band split up at the beginning of 1994, after failing to sign a deal with another label. Mat Flint went on to play bass guitar for Death In Vegas from 1996 onwards, and has released two singles, \"Commodity\" and \"Time To Kill\", with his new band Deep Cut.
