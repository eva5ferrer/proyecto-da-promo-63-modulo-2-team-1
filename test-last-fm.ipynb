Year 2002 finished with a Spanish tour that included more than 70 dates.\\n\\nIn April 2003 Chenoa took part in Eurobest, an European song contest in which she performed \"It\\'s raining men”. Her great stage presence led her to victory.\\n\\nThe unplugged album “Mis canciones favoritas” was Chenoa’s second CD. It was recorded in Barcelona in April 2003, and included some of her favorite songs, such as: Man in the mirror, Respect, Chain of fools or Love of my life. This CD+DVD was released on a limited edition of 100,000 copies for fans.\\n\\n“Soy Mujer” was the chosen title for her second studio album, recorded in Miami and Madrid in 2003. Pop, rock, and latin, arab and anglosaxon sounds are mixed in this CD, which reached number one in the Spanish album chart, and sold more than 230,000 copies after 47 weeks in the Top 100. \"En tu cruz me clavaste\", \"Soy lo que me das\", \"Siete Pétalos\", \"Dame and Soy Mujer were the singles released. Chenoa was nominated again for the Premios Amigo award as best female artist and completed an 80-date tour in Spain. In 2004 she was nominated for the Tu Música award as best new artist, in Puerto Rico.\\n\\nIn May and June 2004 she started “Soy Mujer” promotional tour around Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Argentina.

Venezuela has also awarded Chenoa in 2005 with the Mara de Oro 2005 to the best new international artist of the year.\\n\\nNovember was the month chosen for the release of Chenoa\\'s third studio album \"Nada es igual\". In this pop-rock CD we find a new direction in Chenoa’s music, as it has been produced by Dado Parisini (Laura Pausini, Nek, Tears for Fears), and recorded in Milan. “Nada es igual\" it\\'s not only a sample of her musical evolution, but also of her new personal challenge. Rutinas is the first single.\\n\\nChenoa has still been going strong in the Spanish Charts, although most other reality TV show stars die out soon after. In 2004, her song Dame topped the Spanish charts for three weeks. In 2005, her song Rutinas (Routines) from her new album released in Nov 2005 reached number 4 on its first week, which is a great achievement.\\n\\nAlbums\\n2002 Chenoa - #1 SP \\n2003 Mis Canciones Favoritas (Unplugged Album) - #10 SP \\n2003 Soy Mujer - #1 SP \\n2005 Nada Es Igual - #3 SP \\n\\nSingles\\n2002 \"Atrévete (Mystify)\" - #1 SP \\n2002 \"Cuando Tu Vas\" - #1 SP \\n2002 \"Yo Te Daré\" \\n2003 \"El Centro De Mi Amor\" - #1 SP \\n2003 \"Desnuda Frente A Tí\" - #5 SP \\n2003 \"En Tu Cruz Me Clavaste\" - #1 SP \\n2004 \"Soy Lo Que Me Das\" - #2 SP \\n2004 \"Siete Pétalos\" - #2 SP \\n2004 \"Dame\" - #1 SP \\n2004 \"Soy Mujer\" \\n2005 \"Rutinas\" - #1 SP \\n2006 \"Tengo Para Ti\" — #5 SP \\n2006 \"Donde Estés...\" — release October  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chenoa\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
