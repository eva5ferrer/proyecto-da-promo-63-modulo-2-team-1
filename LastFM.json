After searching for members in Chicago, IL, Static and Jay decided to go to Los Angeles to continue their search. There they met Tony Campos from the Mexican death metal band Asesino, and Koichi Fukuda, completing the band's original line-up. Static-X signed with Warner Brothers Records in early 1998.\n\nThe band's debut album, Wisconsin Death Trip, was released March 23, 1999. Notable songs from the album include Push It, I'm With Stupid, Bled For Days, and Fix. Static-X's touring schedule in support of the album included two Ozzfest stints. The following year saw the release of the little-known EP The Death Trip Continues, and the band contributed the song \"Otsegolation\" to the PlayStation video game Omega Boost. Push It also appeared on the Playstation video games Street Skater 2 & Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes.\n\nAfter recording their follow-up album Machine, guitarist Koichi Fukuda left the band to spend time with his family and pursue other musical opportunities. Tripp Eisen, formerly of Dope, stepped in as Fukuda's replacement. Machine was released May 22, 2001.\n\nStatic-X quickly began work on their third album Shadow Zone, this time with Eisen performing and writing on the album. Before they started recording, however, Ken Jay left the band due to \"political differences.\" Josh Freese of A Perfect Circle was brought in to drum on the album, and Nick Oshiro, formerly of Seether, was later selected as Jay's replacement. Shadow Zone was released October 7, 2003, and July 20, 2004 saw the release of Beneath... Between... Beyond..., a collection of rarities and demos. Later that year, Wayne did guest vocals on the Skinny Puppy song Use Less.\n\nShortly after the release of Beneath... Between... Beyond..., the band commenced work on their fourth studio album, Start a War. In February of 2005, Tripp Eisen was arrested in a sex scandal involving minors, and was fired from Static-X shortly after. Former guitarist Koichi Fukuda, who had been mixing the new album, rejoined Static-X to fill the vacancy left by Eisen. Start a War was released June 14, 2005.\n\nCannibal, released on April 3, 2007, marked the studio return of their original guitarist, Koichi Fukuda. One of the new tracks called \"No Submission\" is available on the Saw III soundtrack. The full track has also been released on Static-X's MySpace page. \"Cannibal\" was released as a digital download single at iTunes. \"Destroyer\" was released as a lead off radio single, before the album was released. Videos for the singles were supposed to be taken at the same time.\n\nOn March 20, the upcoming album was preceded with an exclusive Destroyer EP. The video for \"Destroyer\" has also been produced and is available now at headbangersball.com. The album itself debuted at #36 in the U.S. with sales of over 30,000.\n\nOn May 10, 2007 it was announced that the band would be playing on the main stage at Ozzfest 2007. Additionally, in a recent interview, Wayne Static announced his side-project called \"Pighammer\". The chorus of the song \"Destroyer\" was used in an advertisement promoting the latest video game in the WWE franchise, Smackdown vs. Raw 2008.\n\nIn November 2007, Tony Campos joined legendary industrial act Ministry as a temporary touring bassist for Ministry's C U LaTour in the wake of Paul Raven's death.\n\nThe band began their sixth studio album, Cult of Static, in January 2008 after returning from the Operation Annihilation tour in Australia. In a posting at the Static-X message boards Wayne Static said that this time around he is focusing on longer buildups and break downs like in the Wisconsin Death Trip days of the band, however the album still maintains the heaviness that was present on Cannibal.\n\nOn October 14, 2008 Static-X released their much anticipated live CD\/DVD, Cannibal Killers Live. On December 11, 2008 Wayne Static confirmed on the Static-X Message Board the new album's release date and name saying \"I had hoped to announce it here first, but my publicist beat me to the punch! The new record is indeed entitled \"Cult of Static\" and will be released March 17. The \"cult\" part of the title is not to be taken in any religious manner, I am referring to and giving respect to the loyalty of all you good people that have supported us through the years. This record is definitely darker than Cannibal and has more synths and loops as well. And this is also the most crushing guitar tone I have ever had. There are 11 songs instead of our usual 12, and they are mostly longer and more epic than ever before.\" The album debut at #16 on the Billboard 200 chart, the highest a Static-X album has ever been since their second studio album, Machine.  A new Static-X song called \"Lunatic\" appeared on soundtrack to the movie Punisher: War Zone.\n\nIn 2009, the band performed at the Download Festival. It also was the first time the band made an appearance at Rock on the Range.After finishing their final tour dates in Australia at the end of 2009, Wayne Static announced on the band's official X-Boards that he will now be focusing on his side project Pighammer. In a follow up post he was quoted \"It's doubtful I will do anything with Static-X for the next couple years\" leading fans to interpret that the band is still together and just on hiatus.\n\nLater, he revealed that Tony Campos had left the band, and Campos has since joined the metal band Soulfly, taking over from Bobby Burns. Koichi Fukuda went on to join industrial metal \/ ambient band Drugstore Fanatics.\n\nIn 2010, Wayne Static has been confirmed for Graspop Metal Meeting 2011 as part of his 'Pighammer' solo project. He released his debut solo album \"Pighammer on October 4, 2011.\n\nIn 2012 Wayne Static decided to reform Static-X, but none of the original members will join him. Instead his solo band will tour under the name Static-X.\n\nThe band's musical styles are industrial metal, alternative metal, and occasionally nu metal. But the band rejected the nu metal label and they also call their music as \"evil disco\". The band are influenced by metal and industrial bands like Ministry and Fear Factory.\n\nOn 1st of November 2014, news surfaced of Wayne Static's death. At this point no formal reason has been published for his passing. \nStatic died on November 1, 2014 in Landers, California, three days before his 49th birthday. He had consumed half of an oxycodone pill as well as alcohol that morning before going to bed with his wife Tera Wray. She woke up later that day to find that he had died in his sleep. His family issued a statement stating that rumors of his death being drug-related were false, noting that he and Wray had stopped using illicit drugs in 2009. An autopsy later confirmed that Static had died of multiple prescription drug toxicity, consisting of the painkillers oxycodone, hydromorphone, and the anti-anxiety medication alprazolam combined with alcohol, though the report also noted that years of past \"chronic prescription drug and alcohol abuse\" was a contributing factor.\n\nFormer Static-X members Koichi Fukuda and Tony Campos paid tribute to Static. Static was cremated in California. A memorial rock show followed in Los Angeles, and a family service followed in Illinois. In 2019 it was announced that a new Static-X album would be coming out with a new lead singer named \"Xer0\", who is rumored to be Edsel Dope from the band Dope.\n\nStatic-X released an album titled \u201cProject Regeneration Vol. 1\u201d on July 10, 2020 that features completed tracks that use demos of Wayne\u2019s voice. The original band lineup, minus Wayne Static, contributed to this album as a tribute to Wayne. There are a few songs with the entity, Xer0, involved and one featuring Al Jourgensen from the industrial metal band Ministry. Ulrich Wild returned to produce this album along with Edsel Dope.\n\nAfter multiple pushed back dates, another album called \u201cProject Regeneration Vol. 2\u201d was released on January 26, 2024. It features the last of Wayne\u2019s unfinished vocal demos as well as some Xer0 original tracks. This is the final volume of Project Regeneration.\n\nMembers\nXero \u2013 vocals, lead guitar (2019-present)\nTony Campos \u2013 bass, backing vocals (1994\u2013present)\nKoichi Fukuda \u2013 lead guitars (1994\u20132000, 2005\u2013present)\nKen Jay \u2013 drums, percussion (1994\u20132002, 2019-present)\n\nFormer\nWayne Static \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitars, keyboards, programming (1994\u20132014)\nAshes \u2013 lead guitars (2012\u20132014)\nBrent Ashley \u2013 bass (2012\u20132014)\nSean Davidson \u2013 drums, percussion (2012\u20132014)\nTripp Eisen \u2013 lead guitars (2001\u20132005)\nNick Oshiro \u2013 drums, percussion (2003\u20132012) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Static-X\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

MCs Mr. Funke and DoItAll Dupr\u00e9 met DJ Lord Jazz (a native of Cleveland) when all three were undergraduates at Shaw University[citation needed]. Fellow New Jersey rapper Redman served as one of the group's early DJ's.\n\nThe group released their debut album, Here Come the Lords on March 9, 1993 with production handled by Marley Marl and K-Def. The album peaked at 66 on the Billboard 200 and featured five charting singles, including the group's signature song, \"Chief Rocka\".\n\nThe group released their second album, Keepers of the Funk the following year on November 1, 1994. Keepers of the Funk peaked at 47 on the Billboard 200 and featured three charting singles, the most successful of which was \"Tic Toc\". As stated in a 2013 interview, the group had never disbanded.\n\nThey reunited for a third album with 1999's Resurrection. Released via Queen Latifah's Jersey Kidz imprint, was so small-scale a release that few realized it had been recorded. The Lords returned again in 2007 for a fourth album entitled House of Lords, but like Resurrection, it failed to reach the Billboard charts.\n\nThe Lords are best remembered in connection with the golden age of hip hop. As such, when Nas decided in 2007 to do a remix of his song \"Where Are They Now?\", which asked of the fates of several long-forgotten golden age rappers, the Lords were among those requested to appear. DoItAll Dupr\u00e9 performed eight bars on the track.\n\nDoItAll appeared briefly in the final scene of the final episode of The Sopranos credited as Du Kelly, as one of a series of potentially ominous figures entering the diner. He also appeared on other TV shows; Law & Order as Two Tone, on Oz the HBO series, and on the Christmas episode of 30 Rock on NBC (2008). He has also been in independent movies such as Somewhere in the City with Bai Ling, Rhyme & Reason, and with Treach of Naughty By Nature. He has also starred in an off Broadway play entitled Diss, Diss, & Diss, Dat.\n\nIn 2017, DoItAll revealed he planned on running for Councilman at Large for his hometown of Newark.[1] He started his campaign in 2018, and despite not winning a seat still plans to help the city.[2]  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lords+of+the+Underground\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Gravediggaz blended hardcore hip hop, gangsta rap and heavy metal with horror elements to pioneer the hip-hop subgenre of horrorcore.\n\nThe group was formed in 1992, bringing together Prince Paul (The Undertaker), Frukwan (The Gatekeeper), Poetic (The Grym Reaper) and RZA (The RZArector). It came about largely due to the efforts of Prince Paul. Frukwan and Prince Paul were previously together in the group Stetsasonic. According to Frukwan, the group's name means \"digging graves of the mentally dead, and it stood for resurrecting the mentally dead from their state of unawareness and ignorance.\" The group's lyrics mix black humor (regarding topics such as suicide, death, killing, psychopathy, hell, etc.), criticism regarding the music industry, cartoonish violence reminiscent of the Geto Boys, and esoteric references to the Nation of Gods and Earths. The group pioneered the horrorcore genre.\n\nThe group's first album was originally to be titled Niggamortis; however, this potentially risqu\u00e9 title was changed to 6 Feet Deep for the American market (European versions of the album retained the original title, and also included the bonus track \"Pass the Shovel\"); it was released on August 9, 1994. The four members adopted Gravedigga alter egos for their work with the group: RZA became The RZArector, Poetic became The Grym Reaper, Prince Paul became The Undertaker, and Frukwan became The Gatekeeper. In 1995, the three rapping members (without Prince Paul) released a collaborative EP titled \"The_Hell_E.P.\" with UK trip hop artist Tricky.\n\nThe second full-length Gravediggaz album The Pick, the Sickle and the Shovel was less humorous, dealing more with social and political issues; it also used calmer and more conventional production. Prince Paul played a considerably smaller role in the making of this album, with many of the production duties now taken care of by RZA and his Wu-Tang affiliates (including True Master and 4th Disciple).\n\nA bootleg Gravediggaz album surfaced in 1998, called Scenes From The Graveyard. It featured seven unreleased tracks plus some remixes from the first two albums.\n\nGravediggaz recruited DJ Diamond J. Poetic died of colon cancer in July 2001. Frukwan stated in an interview not long after Poetic's death that a new album using leftover Poetic material would be released. Nightmare in A-Minor, the third official album for Gravediggaz, came out in 2001; it featured two of the original members, Poetic and Frukwan. This album was their darkest work yet, including many references to Poetic's struggle with cancer, as well as apocalyptic themes to do with the teachings of the Five Percent Nation. Although RZA did not take part in the album, some Wu-Tang Clan affiliates such as 4th Disciple, True Master and Beretta 9 were involved. The album was mostly produced by Poetic and Frukwan. A different version of the album (minus the song \"Better Wake Up\") was released in 2002, for which some of the tracks created by Poetic were replaced or altered.\n\nIn 2003 Frukwan released his debut solo album, Life. The fourth Gravediggaz album 6 Feet Under was released in 2004 by Cleopatra Records and featured songs from Nightmare in A-Minor and Life. According to Frukwan, he had nothing to do with the release and claimed that song titles were changed without permission, making it an unauthorized release.\n\nIn 2010, Gravediggaz recorded a new song, \"2 More Cups of Blood\". In 2011, it was announced that the group had been recording new tracks involving Shabazz The Disciple & Killah Priest.\n\nIn 2018, Gatekeeper released \"1 Cup of Blood\" under the Gravediggaz name. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Gravediggaz\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He is widely considered to be one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.\n\nWallace was born and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His debut album Ready to Die (1994) made him a central figure in East Coast hip hop and increased New York City's visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop dominated the mainstream. The following year, he led Junior M.A.F.I.A.\u2014a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 group composed of his childhood friends\u2014to chart success. In 1996, while recording his second album, Wallace was heavily involved in the growing East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop feud. On March 9, 1997, he was murdered by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. His second album, Life After Death (1997), released two weeks later, rose to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. In 2000, it became one of the few hip-hop albums to be certified Diamond.\n\nWallace was noted for his \"loose, easy flow\"; dark, semi-autobiographical lyrics; and storytelling abilities, which focused on crime and hardship. Three more albums have been released since his death, and he has certified sales of over 17 million records in the United States, including 13.4 million albums.\n\nWallace was born at St. Mary's Hospital in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on May 21, 1972, the only child of Jamaican immigrant parents. His mother, Voletta Wallace, was a preschool teacher, while his father, Selwyn George Latore, was a welder and politician. His father left the family when Wallace was two years old, and his mother worked two jobs while raising him. Wallace grew up at 226 St. James Place in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill, near the border with Bedford-Stuyvesant. Wallace excelled at Queen of All Saints Middle School winning several awards as an English student. He was nicknamed \"Big\" because he was overweight by the age of 10. Wallace said he started dealing drugs when he was around the age of 12. His mother, often away at work, did not know of his drug dealing until he was an adult. He began rapping as a teenager, entertaining people on the streets, and performed with local groups the Old Gold Brothers and the Techniques. At his request, Wallace transferred from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School to George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, where future rappers DMX, Jay-Z, and Busta Rhymes were also attending. According to his mother, Wallace was still a good student but developed a \"smart-ass\" attitude at the new school. At age 17, Wallace dropped out of school and became more involved in crime. In 1989, he was arrested on weapons charges in Brooklyn and sentenced to five years' probation. In 1990, he was arrested on a violation of his probation. A year later, Wallace was arrested in North Carolina for dealing crack cocaine. He spent nine months in jail before making bail.\n\nWallace's lyrical topics and themes included mafioso tales (\"Niggas Bleed\"), his drug-dealing past (\"10 Crack Commandments\"), materialistic bragging (\"Hypnotize\"), as well as humor (\"Just Playing (Dreams)\"), and romance (\"Me & My Bitch\"). Rolling Stone named Wallace in 2004 as \"one of the few young male songwriters in any pop style writing credible love songs\".\n\nGuerilla Black, in the book How to Rap, describes how Wallace was able to both \"glorify the upper echelon\" and \"[make] you feel his struggle\". According to Tour\u00e9 of The New York Times in 1994, Wallace's lyrics \" autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty\". Marriott of The New York Times (in 1997) believed his lyrics were not strictly autobiographical and wrote he \"had a knack for exaggeration that increased sales\". Wallace described his debut as \"a big pie, with each slice indicating a different point in my life involving bitches and niggaz... from the beginning to the end\".\n\nReady to Die is described by Rolling Stone as a contrast of \"bleak\" street visions and being \"full of high-spirited fun, bringing the pleasure principle back to hip-hop\". AllMusic write of \"a sense of doom\" in some of his songs and the NY Times note some being \"laced with paranoia\"; Wallace described himself as feeling \"broke and depressed\" when he made his debut. The final song on the album, \"Suicidal Thoughts\", featured Wallace contemplating suicide and concluded with him committing the act.\n\nOn Life After Death, Wallace's lyrics went \"deeper\". Krims explains how upbeat, dance-oriented tracks (which featured less heavily on his debut) alternate with \"reality rap\" songs on the record and suggests that he was \"going pimp\" through some of the lyrical topics of the former. XXL magazine wrote that Wallace \"revamped his image\" through the portrayal of himself between the albums, going from \"midlevel hustler\" on his debut to \"drug lord\".\n\nAllMusic wrote that the success of Ready to Die is \"mostly due to Wallace's skill as a storyteller\"; in 1994, Rolling Stone described Wallace's ability in this technique as painting \"a sonic picture so vibrant that you're transported right to the scene\". On Life After Death, Wallace notably demonstrated this skill on \"I Got a Story to Tell\", creating a story as a rap for the first half of the song and then retelling the same story \"for his boys\" in conversation form.\n\nConsidered one of the best rappers of all time, Wallace was described by AllMusic as \"the savior of East Coast hip-hop\". The Source magazine named Wallace the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue in 2002. In 2003, when XXL magazine asked several hip hop artists to list their five favorite MCs, Wallace's name appeared on more rappers' lists than anyone else. In 2006, MTV ranked him at No. 3 on their list of The Greatest MCs of All Time, calling him possibly \"the most skillful ever on the mic\". Editors of About.com ranked him No. 3 on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987\u20132007). In 2012, The Source ranked him No. 3 on their list of the Top 50 Lyrical Leaders of all time. Rolling Stone has referred to him as the \"greatest rapper that ever lived\". In 2015, Billboard named Wallace as the greatest rapper of all time.\n\nSince his death, Wallace's lyrics have been sampled and quoted by a variety of hip hop, R&B and pop artists including Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Fat Joe, Nelly, Ja Rule, Eminem, Lil Wayne, Game, Clinton Sparks, Michael Jackson and Usher. On August 28, 2005, at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, Sean Combs (then using the rap alias \"P. Diddy\") and Snoop Dogg paid tribute to Wallace: an orchestra played while the vocals from \"Juicy\" and \"Warning\" played on the arena speakers. In September 2005, VH1 held its second annual \"Hip Hop Honors\", with a tribute to Wallace headlining the show.\n\nWallace had begun to promote a clothing line called Brooklyn Mint, which was to produce plus-sized clothing but fell dormant after he died. In 2004, his managers, Mark Pitts and Wayne Barrow, launched the clothing line, with help from Jay-Z, selling T-shirts with images of Wallace on them. A portion of the proceeds go to the Christopher Wallace Foundation and to Jay-Z's Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. In 2005, Voletta Wallace hired branding and licensing agency Wicked Cow Entertainment to guide the estate's licensing efforts. Wallace-branded products on the market include action figures, blankets, and cell phone content.\n\nThe Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation holds an annual black-tie dinner (\"B.I.G. Night Out\") to raise funds for children's school equipment and to honor Wallace's memory. For this particular event, because it is a children's schools' charity, \"B.I.G.\" is also said to stand for \"Books Instead of Guns\".\n\nThere is a large portrait mural of Wallace as Mao Zedong on Fulton Street in Brooklyn a half-mile west from Wallace's old block. A fan petitioned to have the corner of Fulton Street and St. James Place, near Wallace's childhood home renamed in his honor, garnering support from local businesses and attracting more than 560 signatures.\n\nA large portrait of Wallace features prominently in the Netflix series Luke Cage, due to the fact that he served as muse for the creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's version of Marvel Comics character Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Notorious+B.I.G.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

In 1964, at the age of 21, Benson recorded his first album as leader, The New Boss Guitar, with Brother Jack McDuff on organ.\n\nBenson's next recording was It's Uptown with the George Benson Quartet with Lonnie Smith on organ and Ronnie Cuber on baritone sax. This album showcases Benson's talent in constructing swinging bebop lines at blistering tempos. Benson followed it up with \"The George Benson Cookbook,\" also with Lonnie Smith and Ronnie Cuber.\n\nOne of his major hits is the song \"This Masquerade\", which is included in the top-selling album Breezin' . This album represents a shift to more commercially oriented music which brought Benson a wider audience but alienated some jazz fans.

He was the house producer of the Juice Crew, which, in addition to Marley Marl himself, included: Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie, Roxanne Shant\u00e9, Kool G Rap, MC Shan (his cousin) and Masta Ace, and produced songs for outside artists including King Tee and LL Cool J. \n\nHe was also an important figure in the careers of Eric B. & Rakim, as he engineered & mixed their first hits, \"My Melody\" and \"Eric B Is President\". Marley Marl was one of the pioneers of sampling in hip-hop. He debuted as an electro producer, but his records became more sample-heavy, as can be seen by comparing the MC Shan LPs Down By Law (1987) and Born to be Wild (1988).

It was created by rapper Nas, his manager Steve Stoute, producer Dr. Dre and production team the Trackmasters. The group, composed of East Coast rappers Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ and Cormega, was introduced via the song \"Affirmative Action\" on Nas' second LP \"It Was Written\". Due to a falling out between Nas and Cormega, the latter was replaced with Nature.\n\nAlthough the group received initial hype and high expectations from fans upon their formation after collectively signing to Dr. Dre's Aftermath label, The Firm's debut album, The Album (1997), generated disappointing sales and mixed reviews. The album, which featured predominant mafioso rap-themes and production from Dr. Dre and the Trackmasters, was criticized for its mainstream, pop-orientation. Their debut album was the group's only release and it subsequently disbanded in 1998 with each member continuing their solo careers.\n\nThe group reunited for the song \"Full Circle\" on Nas' thirteenth album \"King's Disease\" in 2020.\n\n2) The Firm was an English rock supergroup comprising former Free and Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers, ex-Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, ex-Uriah Heep and Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer Chris Slade and bass player Tony Franklin. Formed in 1984, the band had only mediocre album sales, although they did have sellout tours. Page and Rodgers originally wanted former Yes drummer Bill Bruford and fretless bassist Pino Palladino in the group; however, Bruford was contracted to another label and Palladino had tour commitments with singer Paul Young.\n\nBand members\n    * Paul Rodgers - lead vocals, rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar\n    * Jimmy Page - lead & rhythm guitars, acoustic guitar\n    * Tony Franklin - bass, keyboards, synthesizer\n    * Chris Slade - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\nBoth Page and Rodgers refused to play any material from their former bands and instead opted for a selection of Firm songs plus tracks from both their solo albums. The new songs were heavily infused with a soulful and more commercially-accessible sound, courtesy of Franklin's fretless bass guitar underpinning and understated song structure. Despite refusing to play old material, the last track from The Firm, \"Midnight Moonlight\", was originally an unreleased Led Zeppelin song entitled \"The Swan Song\". This caused some critics to believe that Page had begun to run out of ideas. In subsequent press interviews, Page had indicated that the band was never meant to last more than two albums. After the band split, Page and Rodgers returned to solo work while Chris Slade joined AC\/DC and Franklin teamed up with guitarist John Sykes in Blue Murder.\n\n3) The Firm was a British group from the 1980s comprising of John O'Connor and Grahame Lister, which specialised in novelty songs.  They are best known for the hits \"Arthur Daley ('E's Alright)\" and \"Star Trekkin'\", the latter of which spent 2 weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart.\n\n4) A rock \/ electronic \/ brit pop band from Barcelona, Spain which has released one album \"Hit And Run\" in 2010 yet.\n\n5) French hardcore techno project formed by Darkomen (aka Exced) & Scratch Deal-A (aka The Mastery).\n\n6) band from Rotterdam <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Firm\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Among the ten songs within the album, starting with a prelude, we suggest you listen to \"Features of Love\" and \"You can't get out of my Heart\" to better comprehend the progressive growth of his musical personality.

Kweli first gained recognition through Black Star, a collaboration with fellow MC Mos Def. He released his solo debut album Quality in 2002 and has since released 2004's The Beautiful Struggle, 2005's mixtape album Right About Now, 2007's Eardrum, 2011's Gutter Rainbows and 2013's Prisoner of Conscious. He has also released two albums with Hi-Tek under the name Reflection Eternal and a collaboration album with Madlib in 2007 plus two albums with Res under the name Idle Warship. \n\nHis name is Arabic, meaning 'the seeker' or 'student of truth and knowledge'. His parents were both college professors: his mother an English professor, his father a sociology professor. As a youth, he was drawn to Afrocentric rappers, such as De La Soul and other members of the Native Tongues Posse and in 1995 began recording with producer Hi-Tek and rapper Mos Def who he met at central park, and later attended New York University with. With Mos Def (together the pair were known as Black Star), Kweli achieved some mainstream success with Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star (1998). Also noted are Kweli and Mos' central input on Rawkus Records' compilation album Soundbombing (1997). Soundbombing also include collaborations between Kweli and DJ Hi Tek as Reflection Eternal. Together they released Train of Thought in 2000, which sold better than most alternative hip hop albums at the time. He has since released a critically acclaimed solo debut, Quality in 2002. In 2004, he released his second solo album, The Beautiful Struggle. His third solo album Ear Drum was released on August 21st, 2007.\n\nKweli has created his own record label, Blacksmith Records and has recently signed acclaimed female rapper Jean Grae, with rumors continuing to grow that underground veteran MF Doom is the next artist to be picked up. He left Geffen Records and has signed with the Warner Music Group.\n\nHe has since broken through slightly more towards the mainstream, thanks in large part to several appearance on the comedy show Chappelle's Show, both solo and with long-time collaborator Mos Def, this is due to a friendship between the host and creator of the show, comedian Dave Chappelle and the rapper. He also had a guest spot on friend and frequent collaborator Kanye West's widely successful debut album The College Dropout  on the track \"Get 'Em High\". West has also produced some of Kweli's songs, including his biggest commercial hit \"Get By\". Kweli can also be seen in a commercial for the NCAA's Big Ten Conference, rapping about the league's basketball teams.

(Victor Santiago). The two grew up in the housing projects of Queensbridge and Lefrak City (both in Queens, New York), and met each other in jail in 1992 while doing kitchen duty. \n\nIn 1996, they signed to \"Penalty Records\" in a deal with \"25 to Life\" records (Tragedy Khadafi's label). They were also featured as \"Unsigned Hype\" in The Source magazine. In 1997, C-N-N released their debut trend-setting album, The War Report. With exquisitely dark tracks crafted by Lord Finesse, Havoc (of Mobb Deep), Clark Kent, and a number of other acclaimed producers, The War Report became an instant classic. The unique chemistry of Noreaga's unorthodox lyrcal delivery combined with Capone's street-wise slang, established the duo as a household name within the Hardcore hip hop community.\n\nAfter Capone returned from another stint in jail in 1999 the group then released The Reunion featuring the single \"Ya'll Don't Wanna\". The album struggled to go gold, due to the lack of promotion from Tommy Boy Records, and suffered from mixed reviews. In addition, Capone was sent back to prison right before the release further hurting promotion. Soon after in 2001, Capone-N-Noreaga jumped ship to powerhouse label Def Jam. Because Tommy Boy retained the trademarks to the names \"Capone-N-Noreaga\" and \"Noreaga\", the group was forced to shorten its name to C-N-N, and Noreaga was forced to bill himself as N.O.R.E. for his solo work. They recorded a new album in 2003 called The Religion, with a lead single, \"Yes Sir\", that was issued on mixtapes and promoted by a video. The single failed to make an impact, and the album was shelved.\n\nIn early 2005, Def Jam released Capone from his contract while retaining Noreaga, leaving the group's status in disarray. Capone released his debut album \"Pain, Time, and Glory\", in 2005. \n\nIn 2009 the duo reunited to release Channels 10 and has since then released The War Report: Report to War. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Capone-N-Noreaga\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Jones began performing with his cousin Fredro Starr, and the pair was soon discovered by hip-hop legend Jam Master Jay. Soon after, they formed Onyx. In 1993, Onyx released their first album, Bacdafucup, which became a crossover hit thanks in large part to Sticky Fingaz' gritty style and raspy voice. The group produced two more records before Fingaz left the group to pursue solo projects. Jones also pursued a side career as a film actor. His first solo album, Black Trash: The Autobiography of Kirk Jones, which was released in 2000, is a conceptual album that is cinematic in scope that tells the story of Kirk Jones, a down-on-his-luck ex-con who finds himself wrapped up in the street life.

The saxophonist and clarinetist has deftly incorporated reggae, electronica, hip-hop, funk and Eastern sounds into his boundary-defying repertoire, working alongside luminaries in each genre.\n \nPine began performing professionally as a teenager, forming the hard-bop outfit Dwarf Steps. From there he toured and recorded with reggae artists General Saint and Clint Eastwood. Pine told Down Beat that his nontraditional, eclectic approach was largely influenced by early exposure to renegade saxophonist Sonny Rollins. \"If I'd heard Charlie Parker first, I might have felt alienated,\" he said. \"But Sonny Rollins was playing something I could understand: calypso! He was like my uncle! That sucked me into the music completely!\" With Rollins and legendary saxophonist John Coltrane as influences, Pine began participating in jazz workshops with drummer John Stevens, and soon joined the jazz ensemble of Rolling Stones' drummer Charlie Watts. He went on to tour with pianist George Russell and drummers Elvin Jones and Art Blakey, and led his own small outfits, including the World's First Saxophone Posse. Pine set out to promote the work of black British jazz musicians, and formed Abibi Jazz Arts in 1986. The workshop yielded the Jazz Warriors, an all-black big band that included Pine.\n\nPine released his first album, Journey to the Urge Within, on the Antilles label in 1986, and it became one of the best-selling British jazz albums of all time. Pine remained with Antilles until 1992, recording four more albums for the label and establishing himself in critics' eyes as a potential heir to Coltrane. Several of his albums were produced by Delfeayo Marsalis, the son of jazz pianist Ellis Marsalis (who appeared on 1989's Vision's Tale) and the younger brother of trumpeter Wynton and saxophonist Branford. Pine demonstrated his eclectic interests in his last Antilles release, Closer to Home, a reggae-infused album featuring Jamaican reggae artists and produced by dancehall legend Gussie Clark.\n\nPine continued to surprise on subsequent releases and in performance as well. He guested frequently with British soul diva Mica Paris in the early 1990s and, in addition to Closer to Home, released the African- and West Indian-influenced To the Eyes of Creation on the 4th and Broadway label in 1992. Island released Eyes of Creation, a live LP, in 1995, the same year that Pine released the more orthodox jazz album Modern Day Stories on Verve. Guests on that album included pianist Gerri Allen, singer Cassandra Wilson, guitarist Mark Whitfield, trumpeter Eddie Henderson, drummer Ronnie Burrage and, giving a hint of things to come, turntablist DJ Pogo. Pine told the Toronto Sun that the recording sessions for Modern Day Stories were decidedly atypical. \"These musicians know how mad I am and they sensed this project was gonna be different from others. I didn't approach it the way most people do, which is you go into the studio, you get the chart, you play and you go home,\" he said.\n\nWhile tradition-oriented critics hoped that Modern Day Stories would mark Pine's return to jazz roots, Pine again confounded observers with his Verve release Underground in 1997, which featured a number of accomplished American jazz artists, including pianist Cyrus Chestnut, bassist Reginald Veal, and drummer Jeff Watts, but also incorporated scratching, vocals, and drum 'n' bass beats. This album was more true to his interests, Pine told the London Independent. \"I played so many large halls, wearing a tie, going through the jazz changes, that I just couldn't do any more of it. I'd finish a show and then I'd go back to the hotel room and play a jungle record. It was like, there must be some way of bringing that side into what I was doing.\" He added that \"the itch to play something my younger sister could hear and appreciate without having to know the history of jazz was important to me.\" Pine's live performances also came to be known as nontraditional events, with the musician's high-energy shows often requiring audience participation. A remix album, Another Story, was released on the Talkin' Loud label in 1998.\n\nPine assembled an impressive cadre of British jazz, hip-hop and R&B musicians, including vocalists Kele Le Roc, Beverly Knight, and Eska Mtungwezi, bassist Gary Crosby, guitarist Tony Remi, and rapper MC Mello, for 2000's Verve release Back in the Day. \"I'm signed to an American label and I've been recording with American musicians for a long time but I've been touring with a great British band and I have absolute confidence in them. So why not record them?,\" Pine remarked on Verve's website. \"I think this album is important because it's an opportunity for me to present new players to people who don't know my music.\" While critics may still not have known what to make of Pine's sound, the Queen of England was evidently impressed. Pine was named an officer of the Order of the British Empire on New Year's Eve in 2000.\n\nPine released Devotion on the Telarc label in 2004. He plays a wide variety of instruments and also programs loops on the album, which features a broad tableaux of styles and revisits Pine's interest in Eastern sounds. Included are such artists as members of Transglobal Underground and Young Disciples, as well as tabla luminary Yousuf Ali Khan. Pine told the Verve website that his mission is to redefine notions of jazz. \"It's not just about playing the saxophone anymore,\" he remarked. \"Critics wanted to present me as a student of Rollins and Coltrane but it goes beyond the saxophone. If somebody's telling you that you can't step outside the jazz room then that's wrong. I feel I come from outside the jazz room anyway. What gives me a buzz is when somebody hears my music and hears the different elements at play and says 'I didn't know jazz was like that.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Courtney+Pine\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Earth's music is nearly all instrumental, and can be divided into two distinct stages. Their early work is characterized by distortion, droning, minimalism, and lengthy, repetitive song structures. The band's later output reduces the distortion while incorporating elements of country, jazz rock, and folk. Earth is recognized as a pioneer of drone metal, with the band's Earth 2 being regarded as a milestone of the genre.\n\nDylan Carlson founded the band in 1989 along with Slim Moon and Greg Babior, taking the title \"Earth\" from Black Sabbath's original name. Carlson has remained the core of the band's line-up throughout its changes. Outside of the underground music world, Carlson is perhaps best known for having been a close friend of grunge icon Kurt Cobain, as well as the person who purchased the gun for Kurt before he died. Cobain sang lead vocals in the song \"Divine and Bright\", from a demo included on the re-release of the live album Sunn Amps and Smashed Guitars.\n\nEarth 2 was described as a \"milestone\" by Terrorizer's Dayal Patterson, which he described as \"a three-track, 75 minute deluge of feedback and distorted guitars that marked the blueprint for what Carlson at the time coined 'ambient metal'\". The band went on hiatus after the release of Pentastar: In the Style of Demons due to Carlson's personal problems, including heroin addiction, rehabilitation, his connection to Kurt Cobain's death, and incarceration. Carlson attributed the break primarily to his heroin addiction:\n\n\"At one point, music was everything to me. Then suddenly it wasn't and something else was there, and that was something destructive and damaging. Heroin is part of your life - you don't function without it. It's not like, \"I need to get it to write,\" it's at a much more fundamental level to your existence, like, \"I need it to get out of bed.\"\n\nEarth reappeared around 2000 with a markedly different sound. Its music was still drone based, slow-paced, and lengthy, but it now included a drummer and featured strong elements of country music. Remarking on the stylistic change, Carlson was quick to point to the continuity with Earth's previous sound:\n\n\"In 2001 I started writing again. Originally I had thought it would be something radically different and if it had been I probably wouldn't have stuck with the name. I thought about doing something different at first, but no matter what I do there's always going to be certain elements that are the same, like the slow tempos and repetition. So for whatever reason, I can't help myself - it was still Earth.\"\n\nThe press release for Hex; Or Printing in the Infernal Method (2005) stated the band's music shows \"the influence of country guitarists\/songwriters such as: Duane Eddy, Merle Haggard, Roy Buchanan and fuses it with the vibe of epic visionary composer: Ennio Morricone.\" The press release for The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull (2008) declares \"Earth shows it's [sic] affinity with a nod to the best elements of the more adventurous San Francisco bands of the late 1960s and 1970s, and the more spiritually aware and exciting forms of Jazz-Rock from the same era\" The press release for Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light I describes \"inspiration from both British Folk-Rock bands the Pentangle and Fairport Convention.\n\n2) Earth was an Australian death metal band from Melbourne. They are rarely active as they don't play live, except on occasion as part of international tours. They were well known in the Melbourne Metal scene and played many times at Metal For The Brain (a long-running annual Australian Heavy Metal festival held in Canberra, which ended its run in 2006). They were once signed to High Voltage Records (now possibly defunct) under which they released a full-length album. Former member Terry is now in a band called Canyonaero and Rick and John are now in a band called Darkest Dawn (previously known as The Deadly).\n\n3) EARTH was a Japanese pop\/R&B trio, best known for their song \"time after time\".\n\n4) Earth is a psytrance \/ progressive trance project by DJ Sangeet.\n\n5) Earth was the original name of heavy metal pioneer band Black Sabbath. Earth evolved out of The Polka Tulk Blues Band.  They soon adopted the title of their famous song \"Black Sabbath\" as their band name after they found that they were being confused with another local band also named Earth.\n\n6) Earth is the voice of Icelandic electronic pioneers GusGus.\n\n7)  Earth is a Czech rapper. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Earth\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The duo consists of Atlanta native Andr\u00e9 \"Andre 3000\" Benjamin (formerly known as Dr\u00e9) and Georgia-born Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton.\n\nSpeakerboxxx\/The Love Below is one of only four hip-hop albums to be certified Diamond in the U.S. for shipping over 10 million units.  Along with Outkast's commercial success, they have maintained an experimental approach in their music and are widely praised for their originality and artistic content.\n\nBenjamin and Patton met while attending Tri-Cities High School, a Visual and Performing Arts School. Benjamin's parents were divorced and he was living with his father. Meanwhile, Patton had to move with his four brothers and six sisters from Savannah to Atlanta. Benjamin and Patton eventually teamed up and were pursued by Organized Noize, a group of local producers who would later make hits for TLC. The duo initially wanted to be called \"2 Shades Deep\" or \"The Misfits\", but because those names were already taken they later decided to use \"OutKast\" based on finding \"outcast\" as synonym for \"misfit\" in a dictionary.  OutKast, Organized Noize, and schoolmates Goodie Mob formed the nucleus of the Dungeon Family organization.\n\nOutKast signed to LaFace Records in 1992, becoming the label's first hip hop act and making their first appearance on the remix of label mate TLC's \"What About Your Friends\".  In 1993, they released their first single, \"Player's Ball\".  The song's funky style, much of it accomplished with live instrumentation, was a hit with audiences.  \"Player's Ball\" hit number-one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart.\n\nTheir debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, was issued on April 26th, 1994.  This initial effort is credited with laying the foundation for southern hip hop and is considered a classic by many hip hop aficionados.  Every track on Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was produced by Organized Noize and featured other members of the Dungeon Family.  Follow-up singles included the title track and \"Git Up Git Out\", a politically charged collaboration with Goodie Mob that was later sampled by Macy Gray for her 1999 hit \"Do Something.\"  On this early material, both Andr\u00e9 and Big Boi contrast lyrical content reflecting the lifestyles of pimps and gangsters with politically conscious material commenting on the status of African Americans in the South. OutKast won Best New Rap Group at the Source Awards in 1995.  In the same year, the group contributed \"Benz or a Beamer\" to the popular New Jersey Drive soundtrack.\n\nATLiens was OutKast's second album, released on August 27th, 1996.  The album exhibited more self-consciousness, and further solidified OutKast as the flagship representatives of the 1st generation Dungeon Family and the Southern hip hop movement.  The album helped the group earn more recognition among East Coast hip hop fans in the East and West coasts.\n\nFor this album, OutKast joined with partner David \"Mr. DJ\" Sheats to form the Earthtone III production company, which allowed the group to produce some of their own tracks.  \"ATLiens\" was the group's second Top 40 single (following \"Player's Ball\" from their first album), and reflected the beginning of Andr\u00e9's increasingly sober lifestyle:  \"No drugs or alcohol\/so I can get the signal clear,\" he rhymes about himself. \"Elevators (Me & You),\" OutKast's first self-produced single, became the group's first Top 20 hit the same year.\n\nOutKast's third album Aquemini was released on September 29, 1998 and also reached the number-two position on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States; its title was a combination of the zodiac signs of Big Boi (an Aquarius) and Andr\u00e9 (a Gemini).  The album was widely praised as possibly the group's best material to date: when reviewed by popular hip-hop publication The Source, it received the much-coveted \"5 Mics\" (out of five) rating.\n\nProducing more material themselves, both Big Boi and Andr\u00e9 explored more eclectic subject matter, delving into sounds inspired by soul, trip hop, and electro music.  The album featured production by Organized Noize and collaborations with Raekwon, funk pioneer and musical forebear George Clinton, and Goodie Mob.\n\nIn 1999, OutKast and LaFace Records were sued by Rosa Parks over the album's most successful radio single, which bore Parks' name as its title. The lawsuit alleged that the song misappropriated Parks' name, and also objected to some of the song's obscene language.\n\nThe song's lyrics were largely unrelated to Parks, save for a line in the chorus: \"Ah ha, hush that fuss \/ Everybody move to the back of the bus\".  The song, which OutKast maintained was intended partly as homage, only refers to Parks as a metaphor: the purpose of the song's chorus is to imply that OutKast is overturning hip hop's old order, that people should make way for a new style and sound.  The initial lawsuit was dismissed. Parks' representation hired lawyer Johnnie Cochran to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied on First Amendment grounds.  In 2003, the Supreme Court allowed Parks' lawyers to proceed with the lawsuit.\n\nIn 2004, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyers were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest.  Later that same year, the members of OutKast were dropped as co-defendants, and Parks' lawyers continued to seek action against LaFace and parent company BMG. In 2003 Andr\u00e9 told UK journalist Angus Batey that, following a Detroit concert in the midst of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case was less to do with Rosa than with the lawyers.  The suit was finally settled on April 14, 2005, with neither OutKast nor their label having to admit any wrongdoing. The group did, however, have to agree to perform some sort of tribute to Parks.\n\nOriginally titled \"Sandbox\", the pair's fourth album, \"Stankonia\", was released in October 2000 to excellent reviews.  It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., and would eventually be certified quadruple-platinum.  Stankonia's first single was \"B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)\", a high-tempo jungle-influenced record.  The second single, \"Ms. Jackson,\" combined a pop hook with lyrics about divorce and relationship breakups, particularly Andr\u00e9's breakup with singer Erykah Badu; the titular \"Ms. Jackson\" character being a doppelg\u00e4nger for Badu's mother.  It was at this time that Andr\u00e9 changed his stage name to the current \"Andr\u00e9 3000\".\n\nThe single became their first pop hit, landing the number-one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the number-two position on the UK Singles Chart.  The album's final single was the Organized Noize-produced \"So Fresh, So Clean\", featuring a credited guest appearance from regular guest vocalist and Organized Noize-member Sleepy Brown and garnered a remix featuring Snoop Dogg.   All three singles' videos had heavy MTV2 airplay, and Outkast won two 2001 Grammy Awards, one for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \"Ms. Jackson\", and another for Stankonia as Best Rap Album.\n\nDuring the recording of Stankonia, OutKast and Mr. DJ began producing tracks for the artists on their Aquemini Records imprint through Columbia, including Slimm Cutta Calhoun and Killer Mike, who made his debut on Stankonia's \"Snappin' & Trappin.\"\n\nWebzine Pitchforkmedia.com named Stankonia the 4th greatest album released between 2000 and 2004 in its 2005 feature.  In 2009, B.O.B. was chosen as the number one song of the decade.\n\nIn December 2001, OutKast released a greatest hits album, Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast, which also contained three new tracks. One of these new tracks was the single \"The Whole World,\" which won a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Killer Mike also was featured on the song, gaining some exposure among areas outside of his native Atlanta. The other two new songs were called \"Funkin' Around\" and \"Movin' Cool (The After Party)\"\n\nThe same year OutKast participated in the only Dungeon Family group album, Even in Darkness, along with Goodie Mob, Killer Mike, Sleepy Brown, Witchdoctor, and Backbone among others, and featuring Bubba Sparxxx, Shuga Luv and Mello.  In 2002, the group and Killer Mike contributed the lead single \"Land of a Million Drums\" to the Scooby Doo soundtrack.\n\nIn September 2003, OutKast released a double album, Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below.  It is essentially two solo albums, one by each member, packaged as a single release under the OutKast banner; the two members also appear on each others' discs for a few songs apiece.  Big Boi's Speakerboxxx is largely a funk and Dirty South blended party record; Andr\u00e9 3000's The Love Below features only brief instances of hip hop, presenting instead elements found in funk, jazz, rock, electronic music, and R&B.\n\nThe album is also OutKast's biggest commercial success yet, having debuted on the Billboard 200 albums chart at number-one and stayed there for several weeks.  The album eventually sold over five million copies, and, as double-album sales count double for Recording Industry Association of America certification, the album was certified diamond for 10 million units shipped in December 2004. Its latest certification, in May 2006, reaches 11 million copies in shipping.\n\nThe first two singles from the album(s), which were released nearly simultaneously, were Big Boi's \"The Way You Move\" and Andr\u00e9 3000's \"Hey Ya!\"   The video for \"Hey Ya!\" is based on The Beatles' landmark appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The video's storyline has \"The Love Below\"\u2014a fictional band with all members, through the use of special effects, played by Andr\u00e9\u2014performing in London.  \"Hey Ya!\" was the number one song on the very final weekend of American Top 40 with Casey Kasem.  It was also number one a week later on the very first weekend of American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest.   The singles spent ten weeks at number one on the Hot 100 singles chart, with \"Hey Ya!\" spending nineteen weeks and \"The Way You Move\" briefly taking over in February 2004.   These singles were seen as a breakthrough for the hip-hop industry, being among the first hip-hop songs to be widely played on adult contemporary radio stations.\n\nOutKast's next official single was not released until the summer of 2004.  \"Roses\", a track featuring both members from The Love Below half of the album, did not meet the level of success as either of its predecessors, but it became a modest-sized hit on urban radio and the American music video networks. The video for \"Roses\" is loosely based on the musical West Side Story and Grease.  It featured sparring 1950s-style gangs, one representing Speakerboxxx, and one representing The Love Below, parodying the widespread arguing among critics and fans as to which half of the album was better and that the two members were estranged.   The final singles were Andr\u00e9 3000's \"Prototype\", which was paired with a science fiction-themed video about alien visitors, and Speakerboxxx's \"Ghettomusick,\" which featured both members of OutKast and a sample from a song by Patti LaBelle, who also makes an appearance in the video.\n\nSpeakerboxxx\/The Love Below won the Grammy Award for the 2004 Album of the Year, becoming only the second rap album to ever receive the honor (the first being The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill by Lauryn Hill in 1999).  OutKast was one of the headlining acts at the show, and gave two performances: Big Boi performed \"The Way You Move\" during a medley with George Clinton & P-Funk and Robert Randolph and the Family Band, while Andr\u00e9 3000 performed \"Hey Ya!\" as the show closed.   In February 2004, Andr\u00e9 3000's performance, which featured female dancers moving wildly around a green teepee in war paint and feathered headdresses, was criticized by the Native American Cultural Center, who called for a boycott of OutKast, Arista Records, NARAS, and of CBS, the broadcaster of the awards show. CBS later apologized.\n\nBetween OutKast albums, Big Boi and Andr\u00e9 3000 ventured into film projects.   Andr\u00e9 co-starred in John Singleton's action film Four Brothers and also had a part in Be Cool, while Big Boi took a featured role in the T.I. movie ATL.  Both members also began working on a joint film, Idlewild, directed by OutKast music video director Bryan Barber.   Idlewild, a Prohibition-era musical film set to a blues-influenced hip-hop soundtrack, was released on August 25, 2006 by Universal Pictures.   The Idlewild soundtrack was released August 22, 2006.   Its lead single, \"Mighty 'O'\", features both OutKast members, and was briefly played exclusively on local Atlanta radio stations before being issued as a single in May 2006. They released and shot the video for \"Morris Brown\" instead.   A video for \"Idlewild Blue (Don'tchu Worry About Me)\" soon followed.\n\nAquemini Records folded in 2004, and Big Boi founded a new record label, Purple Ribbon Entertainment, to be distributed by Virgin Records.   Among its first signees were Sleepy Brown, Bubba Sparxxx, and Killer Mike, Big Boi has released a group album\/compilation, titled Big Boi Presents... The Purple Ribbon All-Stars - Got Purp? Vol. 2.\n\nOne album remains on the band's LaFace contract.   It was originally planned as a ten-track release called 10 The Hard Way; shortly after Idlewild was released, the duo confirmed the album is still in the works, though both have begun new projects without releasing any new information on the album.   Due to both Big Boi and Andr\u00e9's interest in separate projects such as movies, TV (Andr\u00e9's Class of 3000) and solo albums, rumors of a split have turned up frequently in the media.   Andr\u00e9 denied those rumors in a phone interview with MTV News, stating that even though they do not feel like performing on stage together, OutKast is \"still tight\".   In an August, 2006, interview with UK journalist Craig McLean, after emphasizing that they would not split, the pair looked beyond music and film careers, Big Boi suggesting he may consider running for the job of Mayor of Atlanta in the future.\n\nIn 2007, Andre 3000 confirmed a new OutKast album would be released, but said that he and Big Boi released solo records first, stating the group album is still possibly two years away.  Big Boi's solo album will be released first in June\/July of 2009, with the first single, \"Royal Flush\" (also featuring Andre 3000, essentially making it an OutKast song), planned to have been released on December 31, 2007, but was not released on the announced date.   Big Boi announced on his MySpace that the release date for Sir Luscious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty is now sometime in the summer of 2009.\n\nOn Nov 14, 2008, the Guardian reported that OutKast will release their follow-up to Idlewild in 2009 after Big Boi and Andre 3000 release their solo albums in the same year.  As of August 2009, the albums have not yet been released.\n\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/OutKast\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Far from it, in fact. The singer has followed a fairly tortuous path to fame, with many ups and downs in his personal life, before achieving his current success.\n\nBorn in Paris on 7 September 1964, Pierpoljak (whose real name is Pierre) grew up in Colombes in the Paris suburbs. Pierre was a difficult adolescent who got into all sorts of trouble and in the mid-70s he got involved in the punk\/skinhead movement. It was around the same time that he took his first steps as a musician, playing bass with a local band called Samu 92. Pierre\u2019s passion for punk eventually led to him moving to London in 1981 where he threw himself into the violent, aggressive sound of the \"No future\" movement. Living in a squat in Stockwell, in south-west London, Pierre gradually came to discover reggae through his Jamaican-born neighbours, listening to the likes of Desmond Dekker and Toots and the Maytals. This proved to be a big musical revelation for him.\n\nPierre eventually returned to France and got into trouble with the authorities, ending up serving time in Fleury-M\u00e9rogis prison. When he got out of jail, the young adventurer decided to take to the high seas, travelling round the Caribbean. Pierre signed up as a member of the crew of a cargo ship and spent the next few years sailing round the French West Indies and the Dominican Republic (an island he grew particularly fond of).\n\nOn his return to France, Pierre took up his old musical activities once again and began to make a name for himself on the Paris underground scene, performing under the pseudonym Brada Peter, then Peter Pan. He managed to get two of his earliest tracks onto the 1994 compilation \"Earthquake\", an album which also featured up-and-coming reggae stars such as Sa\u00ef Sa\u00ef and Tonton David.\n\nSuccess story\n\nBy 1991, Pierre - who, by that point, had changed his stage name to Pierpoljak - was living in the countryside with a wife and child to support. He had started writing and composing his own material in his home studio and his songs soon came to the attention of a major label, Barclay, who offered him a recording contract in 1995.\n\n1996 saw the release of Pierpoljak\u2019s debut album, entirely recorded in the comfort of his own home. One of the songs on it, \"La Music\", ended up remixed by legendary reggae producer Clive Hunt and this boosted the success of Pierpoljak\u2019s album, giving it a second lease of life. A few months later, a new version of the album was released as  \"En Jama\u00efca\", featuring a number of Jamaican DJs toasting on several tracks including \"Annie\" and \"Touriste \u00e0 Babylone.\" Meanwhile, Pierpoljak threw a great deal of time and energy into the live circuit, performing a hectic round of concerts and appearing at the famous Transmusicales festival in Rennes in 1997.\n\nAfter the experience he had acquired in the studio and on the live circuit, Pierpoljak decided the time had come to fulfill one of his oldest dreams and he flew out to record a new album in Jamaica with Clive Hunt. Working in the legendary Tuff Gong studios in Kingston Town, the French reggaeman teamed up with some of the hottest names on the local music scene including drummer Leroy \"Horsemouth\" Wallace and guitarist Earl \"China\" Smith.\n\nPierpoljak\u2019s second album, \"Kingston Karma\", released in June 1998, featured fourteen tracks with superbly-crafted lyrics. It also included an extraordinary reworking of John Lennon\u2019s \"Instant Karma\", characterised by Pierpoljak\u2019s signature vocal drawl. The first single release from the album, the catchy \"Je sais pas jouer\", set the tone for what was to come, proving that French reggae could finally branch out onto the musical mainstream and follow rap to the top of the charts\n\nPierpoljak set off on an extensive national tour in 1998, taking his infectious reggae sound up and down the country. He put in a number of appearances at major French music festivals during the tour and appeared at the Printemps de Bourges in April 1999.\n\nAfter his own personal breakthrough on the French music scene, Pierpoljak embarked upon a collective project in 2000, aimed at demonstrating that Gallic reggae had now emerged in a league of its own. With a helping hand from Jamaican drummer Leroy \"Horsemouth\" Wallace, Pierpoljak got a number of young up-and-coming reggae stars such as Flamengo, Asher, Dynamik and Mathieu Ruben together with a bunch of reggae veterans including Daddy Yod, Supa John, Daddy Mory (a former member of Raggasonic) and Pablo Master. And the whole crew went into the studio together to record \"+2coeur=soleil\", a personal homage to Pierpoljak\u2019s favourite sound.\n\nPierpoljak returned to the studio almost immediately afterwards on his own account to begin work on his next solo album, \"Je fais c\u2019que j\u2019veux.\" Once again, he headed out to Kingston, Jamaica, to work with his old friend, Clive Hunt. But he took a very different approach from his first album, arriving in Jamaica with his songs already written this time. Musically speaking, Pierpoljak\u2019s second album was a pure reggae affair, but in terms of the lyrics \"Je fais c\u2019que j\u2019veux\" drew heavily on the singer\u2019s own personal experiences with a number of openly autobiographical songs such as  \"N\u00e9 dans les rues de Paris\" (Born on the streets of Paris) and the first single release, \"D\u00e9pareill\u00e9\" (The odd one out).\n\nThis second album proved to be a huge hit, earning Pierpoljak a double gold disc in sales. But, unfortunately, the singer fell ill while he was out on the road promoting \"Je fais c\u2019que j\u2019veux\" and underwent a prolonged stay in hospital. At this point, Pierpoljak began seriously questioning whether he had any kind of future in the music business at all. Beset by doubts, he decided to take to the seas once again, setting sail from the Martinican capital Fort-de-France and stopping off at the Canaries and Cape Verde along the way. It was while enjoying another brief stop in Grenada (the Windward Islands) that Pierpoljak happened to hear a burst of local ragga playing on someone\u2019s radio. The experience rekindled his musical spark and, after not picking up his guitar once in four months, the White Rasta was suddenly motivated to start singing and playing again.\n\nBack in Paris, Pierpoljak surrounded himself with positive vibes and threw himself back into songwriting with a vengeance. This proved to be a highly productive period for the singer. Finally, at the beginning of 2003, Pierpoljak headed out to the Tuff Gong studios once again to begin work on a new album.\n\nResolutely roots\n\nSeptember 2003 saw the release of Pierpoljak\u2019s fourth album, \"Stim Turban.\" This was intended to be a resolutely authentic \u2018roots\u2019 affair with no added effects or embellishments. This time round, Pierpoljak did not work with producer Clive Hunt, but took care of everything himself (from the songwriting and the arrangements to the final mix). In the making of this fourth album, the French reggaeman worked with the \u2018cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\u2019 of Jamaican musicians, forming a band called Stim Turban - after whom this fourth album was named. Following the release of the album, \"G\u00e9n\u00e9ral PK\" embarked upon an intensive series of concerts and performed at a number of major French and international music festivals.\n\nAfter a  trip to Tahiti, Pierpoljak was invited to perform at the Reggae Donn Sa festival in Mauritius in August 2005. He returned to the Indian Ocean region in November of that year for a concert in La R\u00e9union.\n\nIn January 2006, Pierpoljak took part in a special \u2018Francophone reggae\u2019 night organised at the Elys\u00e9e-Montmartre, in Paris. On this occasion Pierpoljak shared the stage with the likes of Tonton David and the Ivorian reggae star Tiken Jah Fakoly. And he teamed up with the latter for a live version of \"Si Si\", a duet which featured on his album \"Je blesserai personne\" released in March 2006.\n\nWorking with an artistic director for the first time in his career (despite the fact that he had publicly ridiculed the profession of artistic director on his hit \"J'sais pas jouer\"), Pierpoljak recorded a number of new songs for his new album in France with French musicians. Then he headed off to Jamaica, where he hooked up with producer Clive Hunt once again and worked in a recording studio owned by Shaggy. Pierpoljak\u2019s new album, \"Je blesserai personne\", was much more musically diverse than his previous work and less obviously formatted Kingston reggae-style. In fact, \"Je blesserai personne\" seemed to mark a major turning-point in the French reggae singer\u2019s career, its release coinciding with him cutting off his dreadlocks and breaking away from his Jamaican look.\n\nAnother Pierpoljak album, entitled \"Ch\u00e9per\", was released later that same year and sold exclusively at the singer\u2019s concerts and via his website. Meanwhile, Pierpoljak appeared on the reggae compilation \"Il est cinq heures, Kingston s'\u00e9veille\" (performing  his own reggae-fied version of \"J'ai encore r\u00eav\u00e9 d'elle\" by the group Il \u00e9tait une fois). He also recorded a duet with the Japanese artist Tomuya which featured on Tomuya\u2019s album \"Un Japonais \u00e0 Paris\" (released in March 2007).\n\nJuly 2007 saw the release of \"Tuff Gong Blues\", an album distributed in Germany but not in France. In fact, the album was released in Germany not under Pierpoljak\u2019s name, but under the pseudonym Pekah. The songs on the album (almost all of them in English) had been recorded around the time of \"Je fais c'que j'veux\" and were produced by Clive Hunt. The majority of them were written by Doniki (a singer who appeared on Pierpoljak\u2019s first Jamaican album in 1997). \"Tuff Gong Blues\" featured seven duets with Jamaican artists such as Horace Andy and Anthony B as well as an interesting reworking of Dennis Brown\u2019s reggae classic \"Money In My Pocket.\" Coinciding with the release of \"Tuff Gong Blues\" in Germany, Pierpoljak performed a concert in Berlin at the end of July <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Pierpoljak\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Nel 1997 esce The micranous ep, EP della sua crew, la Sano Business.\n\nIl secondo progetto solista vede la luce nel 1998 ed \u00e8 intitolato Foto di gruppo: un lavoro pi\u00f9 intimista del precedente, in cui \u00e8 possibile apprezzare un sensibile incremento della profondit\u00e0 lirica dei testi: l'artista si confronta con il tema dello scorrere del tempo e del perdurare attraverso esso dei valori fondamentali dell'amicizia e del rispetto. Tracce quali Il tempo che \u00e8 trascorso, Family and Business, nonch\u00e9 l'eponima e bellissima Foto di gruppo costituiscono una riflessione allargata a diversi momenti dell'esistenza il cui comune denominatore \u00e8 rappresentato dalla musica, che tiene insieme i ricordi e permette di prendere le distanze dal reale e di analizzarlo lucidamente. Non mancano brani pi\u00f9 leggeri e cantabili (Dal tramonto all'alba) e altri pi\u00f9 tradizionalmente finalizzati alla definizione del rap come genere (Conosci il mio steelo e Bionic Skillz). Al 1998 risale anche il secondo lavoro della Sano Business, Underground troopers.\n\nIl terzo album di Bassi - che nel frattempo ha consolidato il sodalizio artistico con Dj Zeta e il duo Cricca Dei Balordi noto come Sano Business - risale al 2000, ed \u00e8 Classico. Bassi chiude la parentesi intimista del precedente lavoro e ritorna a toni pi\u00f9 incisivi ed esclamativi, forte di una accresciuta consapevolezza nelle proprie capacit\u00e0 artistiche, derivata dall'ottima risposta del pubblico all'album Foto di gruppo. Il rapper spazia allora dalla analisi disincantata della vita quotidiana di \u00c8 cos\u00ec che va alla celebrazione del proprio stile in Classico, farcendo il tutto con una metrica sempre fresca e delle liriche tanto immaginifiche quanto taglienti.\n\nNel dicembre 2001 vede la luce Rapper italiano, quarto album solista di Bassi. Il disco prosegue sulla scia del precedente lavoro, ma denota uno scarto stilistico e musicale notevole: in esso Bassi dimostra di essere fortemente maturato dal lato della padronanza del sostrato ritmico tipico del genere, sperimentando nuovi tipi di campionamenti e riscoprendo il valore musicale dello scratch (si veda \"Lo capisci o no\"). L'accresciuta orignalit\u00e0 delle rime e dall'eterogeneit\u00e0 degli stili, che variano dalle atmosfere vagamente gangsta di Rapper italiano (in cui Bassi esprime tutto il suo risentimento per lo stato di anonimato in cui versa l'hip hop in Italia e l'incomprensione che lo circonda), all'ironia pungente di The shit dropper fino al crunck ante litteram di Per i miei gorilla, fanno intendere che Bassi Maestro \u00e8 vicino alle vette del suo perfezionamento musicale.\n\nIl 2002 saluta l'uscita del quinto album solista, BackGround, da molti considerato il capolavoro di Bassi ed una pietra miliare nella storia del rap italiano. Sempre nel 2002 Bassi ha l'idea di creare la sua prima raccolta, Classic Gems Vol.1. In questo disco raccoglie quello che \u00e8 il suo vecchio stile, ovvero quello dei suoi primi duel album, Contro gli estimatori e Foto di gruppo. Il successivo lavoro, Classe 73, esce nel 2003 e prosegue sullo stesso tenore dell'ottimo antecedente. Tuttavia, Bassi non riesce ad attingere pienamente alle vette di BackGround.\n\nA un anno di distanza da Classe 73 segue Seven: The Street Prequel, ponte tra Classe 73 e L'ultimo testimone. Seven \u00e8 un album meno teso, a tratti disimpegnato, ma sorretto da un'attitudine street sobria e convincente al tempo stesso. Metricamente molto valido, esso rappresenta una parentesi quasi totalmente votata alla sperimentazione di uno stile italiano che guardi con un certo interesse al gangsta East Coast, tentativo bene esemplificato da Rezpekt, cover di Lean Back della Terror Squad di Fat Joe. In questa direzione vanno letti anche i featuring contenuti nell'album, di Mondo Marcio e Jack the Smoker, lo stile dei quali ammicca alle atmosfere cupe e rancorose della G-Unit.\n\nL'ultimo testimone \u00e8 l'ottava fatica di Bassi. Molti hanno individuato in quest'album una deviazione verso i territori pi\u00f9 lucrosi della musica pop, nel tentativo magari di ritagliarsi una fetta anche piccola della torta del music-biz. Altri pensano che esso testimoni di un'inesausta volont\u00e0 di sperimentare e di rimettersi in gioco. Il 2004 \u00e8 un anno in cui Bassi fatica molto, in quanto produce un album, L'ultimo testimone, uno street album, Seven: The Street Prequel e la terza produzione della sua crew, la Sano Business, Esuberanza.\n\nNel novembre del 2005 esce l'ennesimo lavoro solista del Bax, Hate. La nona tessera del mosaico artistico di Bassi \u00e8 per molti versi un ritorno alle origini, segnato dalla riscoperta delle radici americane del genere, da sonorit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 scarne e old school e dal ricordo dei propri esordi di artista. Quella che dall'album si ricava \u00e8 l'immagine di un Bassi completamente immerso nella sua musica, diviso tra le serate nei club e le attivit\u00e0 di solista e produttore, che hanno contribuito a renderlo prima e a consolidarlo poi come uno degli esponenti di maggior rilievo nella scena. Produttore, solista, intrattenitore: in questi termini si misura il contributo offerto da Bassi alla causa dell'hip hop italiano.\n\nIl 9 novembre 2006 esce il decimo album solista di Bassi, precisamente uno street album, intitolato V.E.L.M. (Vivi e lascia morire), la cui traccia omonima \u00e8 chiaramente ispirata, anche nel tema ricorrente, all'omonimo film della serie di James Bond. Come tipico degli Street Album, sono presenti molti featuring, che vanno da Mc emergenti della scena italiana come Jack the Smoker e One Mic, a nomi pi\u00f9 affermati a livello nazionale come G-Max dei Flaminio Maphia, passando per uno dei migliori produttori attualmente in circolazione, ovvero Don Joe dei Dogo Gang.\n\nNel novembre 2007 esce Sushi ep album che contiene 6 tracce di puro hip hop underground prodotto e rappato da Bassi dedicato a chi apprezza la musica indipendente senza compromessi. Per festeggiare i dieci anni della sua crew, quest'ultima produce Crossover, nel 2007.\n\n\nNel 2008 forma un nuovo gruppo insieme a Lord Bean e Supa: The Dublinerz. A breve uscir\u00e0 il primo album: \"Low Cost Raiders\". <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bassi+Maestro\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

After Jason was replaced by new drummer, Mick Harris, the band changed its name to DOOM.\n\nThis line up played one or two gigs, playing in a crossover metal style. Talbot and Pickering decided this wasn't the direction they wanted the band to move in. Consequently they left Harris and the metal style of music, and decided to go in a Discharge-influenced crossover thrash-style that Doom became known for. Pickering dropped bass to concentrate on vocals and Pete Nash joined as bass player. Harris left for Napalm Death so new drummer Tony 'Stick' Dickens, recently made bandless, joined after a drunken meeting at the infamous Mermaid Pub, this was when the 'real' Doom was formed. The band started rehearsing with this line-up in mid 1987.\n\nAbout this time a small label called Peaceville Records was starting up. They heard about Doom through word of mouth and asked if they were interested in contributing songs to the first peaceville compilation A Vile Peace. Doom went to into the studio to record their first demo on 28 August 1987. Nash unfortunately broke his wrist just before Doom's recording debut, so bass player Jim Whitley (of Napalm Death and Ripcord fame) filled in on the recording. Three songs were recorded (two of which appeared on A Vile Peace).\n\nOn the strength of this first recording Peaceville asked Doom if they would record a full LP for them, which they agreed to do. The War is Big Business demo was recorded on 27 November 1987, which the band sold as a cassette at gigs. In February 1988, Doom went into \"Rich Bitch\" studios and recorded 21 songs for their debut album War Crimes (Inhuman Beings). All this time the band gigged constantly in the UK building up a following on the way. Another demo Domesday was also produced.\n\nAt the end of 1988, due to personal commitments Talbot announced that he would be leaving the band. He stayed long enough to record the split LP Bury the Debt - Not the Dead (with Swedish band No Security) on the Peaceville label. The Police Bastard EP (on discarded records) was also recorded at the same session. Doom were also invited to record two sessions for Radio One's John Peel show around this point. Talbot left the band in April 1989 after completing a lengthy European tour.\n\nDoom continued with different guitarists, most notably with Dave Talbot who co-founded UK doom metal band Solstice with Sore Throat's vocalist Rich Walker, but did not settle with four members for long playing numerous gigs as a three piece, as Pickering turned to vocal and guitar duties. This line up continued until a final split in August 1990. Following the group's demise Pickering formed Police Bastard, whilst drummer Stick joined Extreme Noise Terror then DIRT.\n\nThe band reformed in 1992 with the earlier line up of Talbot, Pickering, Nash and Stick. They toured Japan and recorded a 12\" of new songs released on the label Vinyl Japan. This proved to be the last recording with this line up. About this point the band almost split up but Talbot and Stick decided to continue with two new members. These being Tom Croft from Genital Deformities on vocals and Paul \"Mall\" Mallen on bass guitar. This line up recorded the split album with Selfish and a split 7\" EP with Hiatus. Mall left shortly afterwards (an amicable parting). He was replaced by bassist Scoot from Largactyl.\n\nThis line up recorded the split 7\" EP Doomed to Extinction with Extinction of Mankind, the Fuck Peaceville double LP, and the Hail to Sweden 7\" EP. This is also the line up who appear on the Videodoom video on MCR recorded on a European tour in 1994\n\nA tour of Scandinavia was organised for September 1995, however Scoot decided not to go due to problems at home, so he was replaced by Denis Boardman (of Blood Sucking Freaks) & permanently by Chris Gascoigne (of Suffer) after the tour. Tom Croft also left just after the tour and was replaced by Wayne Southworth (also of Blood Sucking Freaks). While on the Scandinavian tour Doom recorded the Monarchy Zoo 7\" EP at Sunlight Studios.\n\nThe band, now comprised of Stick, Talbot, Boardman, Southworth and Gascoigne, went into the studio in June 1996 and recorded a full LP for Flat Earth, Called Rush Hour of the Gods.\n\nTalbot would go on to join Khang, this band then evolving into Lazarus Blackstar. Stick is also part of the band RUIN.\n\nOn March 18, 2005 Wayne Southworth (lead singer) was found dead in his home by a friend. The cause of death was an epileptic seizure.\n\nThe band then toured England one last time without Wayne Southworth in tribute of their friend.\n\n2) Doom in 1985 They developed into a heavily experimental avantgarde rock\/metal band approaching the 1990s, with broken\/deliberatley quirky use of English in their lyrics also becoming a feature of the music. The classic line up consisted of Takashi \"Taka\" Fujita (vocals\/guitar), Koh \"Pirarucu\" Morota (Fretless Bass) and Jyo-ichi \"Joe\" Hirokawa (drums). Doom released their first EP Go Mad Yourself! in 1985, and the debut album No More Pain followed in 1987. The group gained a significant following and signed to the Japanese label Invitation. They continued to release many more albums and even played a gig at CBGB's before releasing the final album Where Your Life Lies!? in 1999, and then the group later disbanded. The band remains heavily underground today, and information on the band and its members is rare, but they still enjoy a devoted fan base. They were also known for their chaotic, freak-show live performances, with the band members clad in Kiss style make up, having only a large grate as a barrier separating audience & band, and with some of their microphones utilised while dangling from the ceiling.\n\n3) Doom The music for the first two versions of the videogame DOOM created by id Software, was composed by Bobby Prince in the years 1992 and 1993. Some tracks were inspired, almost to be called covers, by famous artists such as Pantera, Slayer and Metallica. Wikipedia has an an detailed list about this. The site Doomworld has a section about the music containing comments from Bobby Prince himself.\n\n4) DOOM is the moniker MF DOOM has chosen for his album BORN LIKE THIS., which was released March 23rd, on Lex Records.\n\n5) Doom was a heavy metal project by multi-instrumentalist Elric Sullivan.  An album called Future Shock was planned to be released, but it is unknown whether or not that album will be released or not.\n\n6) DOOM is an electronic artist from Australia, focused in Drum 'n' Bass and Trap Music. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Doom\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

In 1997, Defari teamed with producer-emcee Evidence of Dilated Peoples and dropped two highly regarded singles, \"Bionic b\/w Change & Switch\" and People's Choice b\/w Bottom Line on ABB Records. Defari gained notoriety and built a reputation as an artist whose music transcended regional barriers. In May of 1998, Defari signed with Tommy Boy Records. In doing so, he became one of the first participants in the West Coast's Hiphop renaissance to in effect \"graduate\". \n\n  \nFollowing the release of his debut album, Defari co-headlined with Xzibit & Phife (A Tribe Called Quest) on The Underdawgs of Hip Hop National Tour in April & May of 1999. He wasn't a newcomer when it came to performing live. Prior to this, he toured the underground circuit for years and received rave review for being one of the most charismatic emcees to hit the stage. His energetic and captivating performances led him to other national & international tours. Rocking a wide range of audiences with some of the major players of the game today. The most current recent N. American tour being the Anger Management Tour where he performed with Xzibit and performed his own material to 20,000 plus crowds each night. Many agree that Defari knows how to bring it like a true seasoned veteran. \n It came to the point in 2000 that the fans were not going to be satisfied with just the 12\u201d vinyl available from Defari. With ABB Records\u2019 new initiative into the European markets, they released their first ABB Europe CD: Defari\u2019s \u201cLA Collexion\u201d \u2013 a collection of all Defari\u2019s vinyl only singles on ABB Records for the first time on CD. The whole pressing was sold out in France alone within 2 days!  \nAn even more heightened profile in the US came after his featuring on Dr Dre\u2019s \u201cChronic 2001\u201d album and touring the world on the \u201cUp In Smoke Tour\u201d with Dre & Eminem. With fans around the world screaming for Defari to face them one to one in shows \u2013 Defari turned to Nicci Cheeks Management in the UK to formalise a new base for his operations outside of the USA, but this time for Europe.   \n High Times Records signed Defari for his 2003 sophomore album \u201cOdds & Evens\u201d featuring all the usual Likwit family: Dilated Peoples, Tha Liks (Tash, J-Ro & E-Swift) and the Barbershop MCs. This was an automatic VIP round trip ticket to the Amsterdam Cannabis Cup in 2002 and 2003, where Defari performed to a very packed out Melkweg every year alongside groups including: Tha Liks and De La Soul. The release of his new album coupled with a fantastic video for the single \u201cSpell My Name\u201d gave fuel to fire for his European management. This has resulted in a 300% increase in Defari\u2019s press, radio and TV coverage (including a special feature documentary about Defari on VIVA TV\u2019s \u201cMixery Raw Deluxe\u201d show during May 2004)\u2026 and ultimately his touring capabilities as a solo artist. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Defari\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most lyrical rappers of all time, and is known for helping to pioneer horrorcore.\n\nEmerging from Harlem, New York in the early to mid-1990s, Coleman became well known amongst underground hip-hop fans for his freestyling ability, and was eventually signed to Columbia Records, where he released his debut album, Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous in 1995 and is now considered by many fans as a classic album. On February 15, 1999, Coleman was shot nine times and killed by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in his hometown of Harlem.\n\nNoted for his use of wordplay, multiple writers at AllMusic, HipHopDX and The Source have praised Coleman for his lyrical ability, and he has also been described as \"one of the most auspicious storytellers in hip hop history.\" Regarding Coleman's legacy, Nas said on MTV, \u201cHe scared me to death. When I heard that on tape, I was scared to death. I said, \u2019Yo, it\u2019s no way I can compete if this is what I gotta compete with.'\n\nLamont Coleman was born in Harlem, New York City, on May 30, 1974, the third and youngest child of Gilda Terry (d. 2008) and Charles Davis. Davis left the family while Coleman was a child. His two older siblings, Donald Coleman and Leroy Phinazee (d.2002), were the children of Gilda and a man named Mr. Phinazee. Coleman received the nicknames \"Little L\" and \"'mont 'mont\" as a child. At the age of 12, Coleman became a big hip hop fan and started freestyling with other people in his neighborhood. He founded a group known as Three the Hard Way in 1990, but it was quickly broken up due to a lack of enthusiasm amongst the members. It consisted of Coleman, Doc Reem, and Rodney. No projects were released, and after Rodney left, the group was renamed Two Hard Motherfuckers. Around this time, people started to refer to Coleman as \"Big L\". In the summer of 1990, Coleman met Lord Finesse at an autograph session in a record shop on 125th Street. After he did a freestyle, Finesse and Coleman exchanged numbers.\n\nColeman attended Julia Richman High School. While in high school, Coleman freestyle battled in his hometown; in his last interview, he stated, \"in the beginning, all I ever saw me doing was battling everybody on the street corners, rhyming in the hallways, beating on the wall, rhyming to my friends. Every now and then, a house party, grab the mic, a block party, grab the mic.\" He graduated in 1992.\n\nOn February 15, 1999, Big L was killed at 45 West 139th Street in his native Harlem after being shot nine times in the face and chest in a drive-by shooting. Gerard Woodley, one of Big L's childhood friends, was arrested three months later for the crime. \"It's a good possibility it was retaliation for something Big L's brother did, or Woodley believed he had done,\" said a spokesperson for the New York City Police Department. Woodley was later controversially released, and the murder case remains unsolved.\n\nBig L is buried at George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey.\n\nOn June 24, 2016 at 139th St. and Lenox Avenue, Woodley, 46, was shot in the head and later died at Harlem Hospital.\n\nColeman is often credited in helping to create the horrorcore genre of hip hop with his 1992 song \"Devil Son.\" However, not all his songs fall into this genre, for example, in the song \"Street Struck\" Coleman discusses the difficulties of growing up in the ghetto and describes the consequences of living a life of crime. Idris Goodwin of The Boston Globe wrote that \"[Big L had an] impressive command of the English language\", with his song \"Ebonics\" being the best example of this.\n\nHe was notable for using a rap style called \"compounding\". Coleman also used metaphors in his rhymes. M.F. DiBella of Allmusic stated Coleman was \"a master of the lyrical stickup undressing his competition with kinetic metaphors and a brash comedic repertoire\". On the review of The Big Picture, she adds \"the Harlem MC as a master of the punch line and a vicious storyteller with a razor blade-under-the-tongue flow.\" Trent Fitzgerald of Allmusic said \"a lyrically ferocious MC with raps deadlier than a snakebite and mannerisms cooler than the uptown pimp he claimed to be on records. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Big+L\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He grew up on the streets of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, hanging with the likes of ODB - who actually gave the Budha Monk his name. They knew each other since childhood as they grew up in the same neighborhood and kept bumping into each other at parties on Franklin Ave. Buddha Monk said on the subject, \"I would be DJ'ing and Dirty would show up and start rhyming. Then he\u2019d take the turntables and I\u2019d get the mic. Since we were kids, we knew we were gonna always remain family\u201d.\n\nOne day when ODB was in the studio, Monk gave suggestions on production and the RZA was pleased with his contribution and gave him permission to work with the Clan. He ended up singing backing vocals on CREAM aswell as appearances in several videos including Da Mystery of Chessboxin' and Brooklyn Zoo. \n\nIn 1998, after the proverbial years of struggling in the streets and hopeful records deals gone sour, it was Buddha Monk\u2019s time to shine. The Prophecy was finally revealed to the masses and received both fans and critical acclaim. The album was dubbed hard-hitting without being too self-conscious.\n\nOn the first single, \u201cGots Like Come On Thru\u201d featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard, Buddha applies the lessons that Dirty taught him: \u201cnot to clutter my music, to take my time and breathe, to harmonize and slurf my words\u201d combined with Buddha's own ideas: \u201cto make it swerve and have that extra funk that everybody can enjoy.\u201d On tracks like \u201cWarrior Chiefs\u201d and \u201cEastside Story\u201d, Buddha collaborates with other Brooklyn talents, such as Da Manchuz, who he's developing as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\n\nYears later, we would hear a lot more of Buddha\u2019s Brooklyn Zu family with the release of the Zu-Chronicles series on Chambermusik Special Products. But between those times, the tragic passing of Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard in 2004 almost put an end to Buddha Monk\u2019s career. Devastated by the loss of one of his closest friend and music compadre, the Crown Heights native thought about quitting the rap game altogether. After taking a hiatus, General Monk returned through the underground circuit with one goal in mind: ensure that ODB\u2019s legacy lives on.\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, Buddha Monk has toured the world, worked with people from all over the planet, including more than 250 artists in the Brooklyn area alone and produced over 10,000 tracks.

A lot of confusion has existed over the exact members of this group. It was even suggested that Popa Wu was once a member. Early radio freestyles featuring Royal Fam featured some unknown artists. Two of which were Roc and Jahrule (not of the Murder Inc.) - both were present on the track \"Army Brickaid\" from Royal Fam's unofficial debut release. Timbo King has made mention that the Royal Fam consists of mainly 3 members, himself, Dark Ages & Malachi and Y-Kim the Ill Figure as the producer with featuring or introducing others, which have not been mentioned, certainly the presence of Roc and Ja Rule would support this statement.\n\nTimbo King is undoubtedly the group's main MC handling the majority of rhyming duties. Dreddy Kruger has also made a number of Wu-Tang album appearances. Dark Denim released a solo track early in his career called \"Doin' Our Thang\" featuring Lord Smooth, under the name Dark Ages.\n\nEarly in their inception, an album called \"Black Castle\" was rumoured to have been recorded, and was to be jointly distributed by Capitol Records and Wu-Tang Records. The album even had a \"catalogue number\", a right which is reserved only for completed albums, EP's or singles. This would suggest some truth to this mystery, but as yet, only a handful of tracks from this supposed album has been released. \n\nIn early 2000, copies of a Royal Fam album, \"Yesterday, Today Iz Tomorrow\", was released in Europe and was subsequently made available worldwide, without the knowledge and consent of the group itself. Y-Kim has promised to release the album officially. \"Days, Months, Yearz\" was released but is very rare and hard to come across CD. Around 2006, Nature Sound Records geared up to release the long lost \"Black Castle\" as presented by Timbo King but the album got shelved due to unknown reasons with only promos released to DJs, promoters and so on.\n\nThe group have also gone under the name Royal Famous.\n\nMembers (Past and Present):\n\n- Benny Boom\n- Dark Denim (aka Dark Ages, Dark Knight)\n- Dreddy Kruger (aka Dutch Master)\n- Jahrule\n- Mighty Jarrett (aka Malachi, Mighty Jarrad)\n- Q-Base (aka the Royal Visar)\n- Roc\n- Stoneface (aka ShaRecka)\n- Timbo King (aka King Tymel, Timbuktu, Bo King)\n- Y-Kim the Ill Figure\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:\n\nSummin' Gotz To Give bw\/ I Declare War (1995)\nYesterday, Today, Iz Tomorrow (2000)\nYears Months Dayz (2004)\nBlack Castle (2006) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Royal+Fam\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Trading verses effortlessly, the two can create magic on the mic ranging from intricate storytelling to battle raps.\n\nHailing from Pontiac, Michigan \u2013 Lo and Senim originally met in high school and instantly developed a close friendship. However one poor decision that could have easily derailed their career, made the bond between them stronger and more focused. An armed robbery conviction landed them both in prison for a three-year sentence and during this time Binary Star officially came into existence in 1998.\n\nUpon their release, Lo and Senim had grown more mature, focused, and immediately began recording what would evolve into Masters of the Universe and the classic song \"Reality Check\". Binary also had plenty of beats waiting from longtime friend Decompoze , who would co-produce a majority of the album.\n\nAfter initially pressing up CD, vinyl, and tape copies \u2013 the Binary Star buzz earned the group a distribution deal that would convert music listeners into loyal fans with the release of M.O.T.U. in 2000. It went on to sell over 25,000 units and showed the viability of independent hip-hop during a time when major labels had begun the commercialization of rap music.\n\nShortly after recording the M.O.T.U. album, the two parted ways claiming creative differences. One Be Lo developed his own solo career by rocking shows across the country. In 2005 his solo debut S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M. moved over 22,000 units on Fat Beats Records. Lo also kept fans happy with several releases on his own Subterraneous Records: Project: F.E.T.U.S., S.T.I.L.L.B.O.R.N., and The R.E.B.I.R.T.H.. This has set the foundation nicely for the highly anticipated B.A.B.Y.\n\nThey reunited briefly in 2002, doing a concert together at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont, but they did not record any new material. Although there has inevitably been speculation about a reformation of Binary Star, One Be Lo has stated that this is unlikely. \"I seriously doubt it\", he said, proceeding to claim, \"Artists are real, real picky and real, real closed minded. They can be real, real strongly opinionated. If there ain\u2019t no real chemistry, it ain\u2019t going to work.\"\n\nIn 2009, recently reuniting after a 10-year hiatus, Binary Star is back in the studio working on its long awaited follow-up to the classic debut album Masters Of The Universe (M.O.T.U.). Tentatively titled \"Light Years Apart,\" the duo's EP serves as a mere prequel to a full-length LP. \n\nOn March 29, 2013, Binary Star released their first album in thirteen years, a self-titled EP, as a celebration of their 15th anniversary as a duo. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Binary+Star\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The LP's sound was close to classical 90s hip-hop such as Black Moon and Gang Starr. It featured the then-elite of Norwegian rappers; Apollo, Definite and Pen Jakke, and is reckoned a classic among Norwegian hip-hop heads.\n\nIn 2002, they followed with \"M\u00f8rketid\".

He is a close friend ever since the age of 17 of DJ Funkmaster Flex. Known for the popular Hip hop singles \"Any Emcee\" and \"Whutcha Want?\" which were both produced by longtime collaborator and fellow Bronx native Rob Lewis, Nine then known as 9MM got his big break in late 1993 as an artist on the \"Deuces Wild\" (a group formed by Nine and Funkmaster Flex as well as others, then renamed \"Funkmaster Flex and the Ghetto Celebs\" after Nine's departure) song \"Six Million Ways to Die.\" The verse showcased Nine's harsh, gravelly flow he had created to give him his own originality. Because of this He was signed to a deal with the now-defunct Profile Records, that had a roster of artists such as fellow rappers Run-D.M.C. , DJ Quik and Special Ed.\n\nKeyes originally recorded under the Monikers \"9MM\" (or \"Nine Double M\") before changing his name to simply \"Nine\".This was because as he stated \"I didn't want to be just be named after the gun (9mm).\" His artist name (Nine) refers to his date of birth (9\/19\/1969), shoe size Nine and his lucky number 9.\n\nRapper Nas recently referred to \"9 Double M\" on the track \"Where Are They Now?\" from his album Hip Hop Is Dead.

Most of songs are covers of anime openings\\endings songs.\n\n3) NINE formed in Athlone, Cape Town in June 1992 and played their first gig six months later at The Stage in Cape Town. In keeping with their experimental edge and desire to fuse different musical forms, the name Nine is not intended to have any specific connotations. It can mean anything and nothing, and reflects the bands' intention of breaking down barriers between different cultural and musical paradigms.\n\nAfter five years rising through the South African musical underground, the four piece of Farrell Adams (vocals), James Reynard (guitar), Grenville Williams (bass guitar) and Jerome Reynard(drums) now find themselves enjoying critical acclaim on the back of their two contributions to the Oppikoppi Live CD (the only band to have more than one song included). The launch and release of their second CD, Entropy, is imminent and the band are gearing up for 1998 that should see their eclectic fusion of diverse musical forms moving into the spotlight. \n\nThe band's wide range of influences take in everything from rock, funk and hip hop to drum 'n bass, jazz and reggae, their constant shifting of boundaries means Nine are a band who defy convenient categorisation. \n\nDespite their fiercely independent outlook and underground status, Nine have developed a sizable following at concerts like Oppikoppie, Rustler's Valley, Wingerdstock and Up The Creek. The band also proved to be a major hit at the 5FM Birthday Bash in 1996 and recieved widespread praise on their nationwide Benson & Hedges Bandslam Tour in 1996 along with the Springbok Nude Girls, Squeal, Lithium and Sugardrive.\n\nNine's song, \"Last Tear\", was also included on the \"My Generation\" compilation CD of South African bands along with Squeal, Springbok Nude Girls, Lithium and others and limited copies of their ephonymously-titled debut CD are still available. Their new CD, Entropy, is an independently produced album that contains studio versions of live favourites such as Talk Too Much, Wanton Panorama and Ground as well as cutting-edge new songs like Revolution, Chemistry, Episode and others. \n\n4) Nine are one of Sweden's greatest metal\/hardcore exports. In the last three years Nine have released two infectious albums on Sweden's legendary Burning Heart record label \"Lights out\" (2001) and \"Killing angels\" (2003). (Both albums were quickly met with rave reviews from listeners and critics alike). Propelling the band to new heights of praise and popularity within the European aggressive music scene. \"Killing Angels\" is released in the US by the mighty DEATHWISH Records.After Scandinavian touring with the likes of The Haunted and Nasum, Nine made major noise when they hit the road of Europe with Entombed, Disfear, The Hope Conspiracy, and later Converge. On these tours their immense power was truly undeniable. Nine roared through unsuspecting crowds like a runaway freight train, bringing new life to the unforgettable \"Swedish\" sound.\n\nNine was formed in Link\u00f6ping 1994 and before the BHR years, Nine released two albums \"Listen\" (1996, Startracks rec) and \"Kissed by the misanthrope\" (1998, Sidekicks records) and one MCD \"To the bottom\" (1995, No Looking back records).

As he struggles to write the script for his latest film, Italia, he's forced to balance the numerous formative women in his life, including his wife, Luisa ; his mistress, Carla Albanese; his film star muse, Claudia Jenssen; his confidante and costume designer, Lilli La Fleur; an American fashion journalist, Stephanie; a prostitute from his youth, Saraghina; and the spirit of his deceased mother, Mamma.\n\nThroughout the film, it is slowly revealed that Guido has been traumatized by his strict Catholic childhood, and it is implied he was beaten in boarding school. In present-day, he frequently has visions of his mother, and their love for each other. Guido has not written a word for Italia, although the press, the public, and his crew believe it is complete. Things are further complicated when Guido gets away to a spa retreat, whereupon Carla follows him and they secretly lead a life of love in the musty train station town. Soon, Luisa discovers truths, Claudia admits details, Lilli listens, Saraghina haunts, and Stephanie attempts to woo Guido with her charm.\n\n6) NINE is lithuanian house producer from Vilnius.  https:\/\/ninenein.bandcamp.com\/\n\n7) Nine is a member of the Korean boy group  OnlyOneOf. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nine\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He was born in 1987 in Moscow, Russia. Even in his childhood his parents noticed he was a very talented kid and placed him in an art school. He had not been thinking about being a musician after in years, until he heard some broken beats of an old jungle tune. So that's how Pavel's career began in 2001.\n\nLoads of tracks in different styles (everything from hip-hop to uplifting trance) had been written since 2001, and only in 2003 Paperclip produced his first drum&bass tune. Not long after he realized that drum&bass was a drug, and there was no way back. His dip into the abyss of broken rhythms was impetuous and irreversible. Rest of the music just became irrelevant.\n\nA bit later, the preferences became obvious - neurofunk, mainstream, technoid, and Stakka & Skynet, Dom & Roland, Ed Rush & Optical, Cause 4 Concern, Teebee, Ram Trilogy, Usual Suspects and Bad Company UK became his favorite producers and a sort of virtual tutors. Listening to their music, Pavel aimed to reach the sound which could be consistent with the sound of his idols. Years of hard work have helped Paperclip not only answer their sound, but even work out his own signature.\n\nThere was one problem after all the quality was something to be desired in his tracks. This problem got solved when Pavel began to post his tunes on music forums: people helped with their advice, and in this manner the quality of his tunes gradually improved.\n\nAt the present time, Pavel cooperates with many Russian and foreign producers, radio stations and labels. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Paperclip\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

This is when he started being recognized as an individual rapper for the first time, making hip-hop more familiar to Japanese listeners. In the same year he started the first hip-hop TV program in Japan, titled Beats to the Rhyme. One of Zeebra's songs was used in a Nike promotion video for NBA Japan games. The following year Zeebra released the single \"Mr. Dynamite\", the first hip-hop single to break into the top 50 on the Japanese pop charts. In June 2000, he released his new album Based On a True Story, which sold 250,000 copies. At the end of that year Zeebra started his first Japan tour, the first hip-hop event to sell out. In 2001 Zeebra released the single \"Never Enuff\", the theme song for a Japanese movie called Brother, directed by Takeshi Kitano and starring Claude Maki. In 2002 he temporarily rejoined King Giddra, but has been doing solo work since 2003 and has released many songs. At present, he is producing songs not only for rap artists, but also for pop stars like Namie Amuro.\n\nHip-hop is now firmly ensconced in the Japanese music scene, to the extent that it is even heard as background music. This would probably not have happened without Zeebra, who is often considered the originator of the Japanese hip-hop scene. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/ZEEBRA\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Shang's humble beginnings started much the same as her peers in the powerful world of gospel music through traditional singing in the church choir. Shang\u2019s vocal gift began in the late 1940\u2019s with her grandmother Louvenia Carroll who was a member of the Legendary Clara Ward Singers.  Throughout the years, Shang and her family have laid a tremendous mark on the gospel world, spreading the gospel up and down the east coast.\n\nAt an early age, Shang decided to branch out into other aspects of music. This continued into her late teens and early twenties where she molded herself into a well rounded and diverse vocalist in all aspects of music. Several artists and management agencies began to notice her as a young vocalist with an excellent natural ear for music.  Before long she began receiving requests to sing background and fill in spots for various artists in the local area. She was quickly picked up by international recording artist, Nathan Heathman of Washington DC, who had been the musical director of the Great Phyllis Hyman until her untimely departure. Shang\u2019s accomplishments can only be expressed by naming some of the great venues at which she has performed; the Legendary Blues Alley in Washington DC, DAR Constitution Hall in Washington DC, Hampton Jazz Festival in Hampton Va., Madison Square Gardens in New York, Aretha Franklin\u2019s Birthday Celebration along with\u201d Mr. Personality\u201d himself  Lloyd Price.

Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Arnold was a member of Charles Thompson and the Majestics, a traveling 12-piece gospel choir prior to signing a solo recording contract with Arista Records in 1995. \n\nIn 1991, at the age of eleven, Monica was discovered by music producer Dallas Austin at the Center Stage auditorium in Atlanta performing Whitney Houston 1986's Greatest Love of All. Amazed by her voice, Dallas offered her a record deal with his Arista Records-distributed label Rowdy Records and consulted rapper Queen Latifah to work as Monica's first manager. Shortly afterwards Dallas and then staff producers Tim & Bob entered the studio with Monica to start writing and producing her debut Miss Thang which was eventually released in July 1995 and scored number thirty-six on the U.S. Billboard 200 and number seven on the Top R&B Albums chart. It was certified triple platinum by the RIAA for more than three million store-shipped copies and produced three top ten singles, including debut single Don't Take It Personal (Just One of Dem Days) and Before You Walk out of My Life both of which made Monica the youngest artist ever to have two consecutive chart-topping hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot R&B Singles chart. Miss Thang subsequently won Monica a Billboard Music Award and garnered her an American Music Award nomination in the Favorite Soul\/R&B New Artist category.\n\nAfter a label change to Clive Davis's Arista Records, Monica mainstream success was boosted, when Diane Warren-written For You I Will, from the Space Jam soundtrack, became her next top ten pop hit. The following year she was asked to team up with singer Brandy and producer Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins to record The Boy Is Mine, the first single from both of their second albums. Released in May 1998, surrounding highly publicized rumors about a real-life catfight between both singers, the duet became both the biggest hit of the summer and the biggest hit of 1998 in general in America, spending record-breaking thirteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It earned the pair a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and garnered multi-platinum sales (to date, it remains as one of the top twenty most successful American singles in history based on Billboard chart success).\n\nJermaine Dupri, David Foster and Austin consulted on the album The Boy Is Mine, which was released later that year and eventually became Monica\u2019s biggest-selling album, becoming certified triple platinum by the RIAA for more than three million store-shipped copies. It yielded another two U.S. number-one hits with The First Night and Angel of Mine, a cover of Eternal's 1997 single, as well as a remake of Richard Marx' Right Here Waiting. Rolling Stone Magazine proclaimed it as \"closer to soul's source... hearking back past hip-hop songbirds like Mary J. Blige and adult-contemporary sirens like Toni Braxton,\" while Allmusic called the album an \"irresistible sounding [and] immaculately crafted musical backdrop [...] as good as mainstream urban R&B gets in 1998.\"\n\nIn 2000, Monica contributed chorus vocals for I've Got to Have It, a collaboration with Jermaine Dupri and rapper Nas. Released as the Big Momma's House theme song, the song saw minor success in the United States only. The following year, she released the Ric Wake production track Just Another Girl, recorded for the Down to Earth soundtrack, as a single.\n\nA year later, Arnold channeled much of her heavily media-discussed experiences into the production of her third studio album, All Eyez on Me, her first release on mentor Clive Davis newly-founded J Records label. \"I just wanted to give the people back something that had personal passion, instead of just, 'Oh, let's dance to this record',\" she said about the issues worked into the tracks. The first single All Eyez on Me a Rodney Jerkins-produced R&B-dance track, saw minor to moderate success on the international charts but failed to enter the higher half of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. A follow-up song, Too Hood, also got a lukewarm response and as a result, the album's tentative release was pushed back several times. \"I don't think people wanted to hear a big fun record from me, after knowing all the things that I had personally experienced,\" Monica second-guessed her new material which saw both early and heavy bootlegging via internet at that time.\n\nAfter the Japan-wide release of All Eyez on Me Monica was asked to substantially reconstruct the record with a host of new producers, and as a result the singer re-entered recording studios to start work with songwriters Kanye West, Jazze Pha, Andre \"mrDEYO\" Deyo, Bam & Ryan and Dupri-replacing executive producer Missy Elliott. Finally released in June 2003, After the Storm debuted at number one on Billboard`s Top R&B\/Hip-Hop albums chart, and on top of the official Billboard 200, with sales of 186,000 copies emerging as Monica's first and only number-one album to date. It eventually received a gold certification, and has sold over one million copies domestically. Media reception of the CD was generally enthusiastic, with the Allmusic saying the album \"has all the assuredness and smart developments that should keep Monica's younger longtime followers behind her \u2014 all the while holding the ability to appeal to a wider spectrum of R&B and hip-hop fans.\" The album's lead single, Elliott-penned So Gone, was one of Monica's biggest commercial successes in years, becoming her first top ten single since 1999's Angel of Mine. In addition, it reached the top position of the Billboard R&B\/Hip-Hop Tracks and Hot Dance Club Play charts. Subsequently, After the Storm spawned another three singles, with final single U Should've Known Better reaching number nineteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nIn 2005, Monica appeared on the Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman soundtrack. The track was one of Monica's last production by Dallas Austin.\n\nReturning from yet another musical hiatus, Arnold's fourth studio album The Makings of Me was released in October 2006. Titled after Curtis Mayfield's 1970 recording The Makings of You, the album saw her particularly reuniting with producers Elliott, Dupri, and Bryan Michael Cox, all of whom had previously contributed to After the Storm (2003). The Makings of Me received a positive reception from most professional music critics, with Allmusic calling it a \"concise and mostly sweet set of songs,\" and Entertainment Weekly declaring it \"a solid addition\" to Monica's discography. While it debuted at number one on Billboard's Top R&B\/Hip-Hop albums chart, and at number eight on the official Billboard 200, it received a domestic sales total of 328,000 copies, it widely failed to revive the success of its predecessors and became the singer's lowest-selling effort to date. Singles such as snap-influenced Everytime Tha Beat Drop featuring Atlanta hip hop group Dem Franchize Boyz and Elliott-produced A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me) failed to reach the top forty of the regular pop charts.\n\nIn 2009, Arnold lent her voice to the ballad Trust a duet with Keyshia Cole, that peaked in the top five on Billboard Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The recording of Arnold's sixth studio album Still Standing was chronicled by her BET reality series of the same name. Featuring production by Stargate, Ne-Yo, and Polow da Don, it was released in March 2010 and garnered a generally positive response by critics, who perceived its sound as \"a return to the mid-'1990s heyday\" of contemporary R&B, The album debuted atop on Billboard's Top R&B\/Hip-Hop albums chart, and number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 with opening week sales of 184,000 copies, becoming the singer's second highest-charting debut since 2003's After the Storm. The leading single Everything to Me scored Monica her biggest chart success since 2003's So Gone, reaching the top position of the Billboard R&B\/Hip-Hop Tracks charts for seven weeks. The album was certified gold by the RIAA with domestic shipments of 500,000 copies within a single month. With it success, the album and Everything to Me was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&B Album and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, presented at the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011. In August 2010, Arnold joined Trey Songz on his Passion, Pain & Pleasure Tour, her first North American concert tour in ten years.\n\nThe New Life (Intro) Songfacts reports that New Life was Monica's debut release with RCA, following the disbandment of her former label, J Records in October 2011. The album was dropped on April 10, 2012 in the US. She explained the meaning of its title on Twitter: \"A good word goes a long way. Life is hard enough. Me and my followers believe in God, love, strength, family, unity and growth [...] Don't be afraid of new things, new people, new opportunities or new love. It just may give you a New Life.\"\n\n2.

Here's their story:\n\nStyly Cee :\"I've been into hip-hop since about 1983, when I was 11. In 1985 I started going regularly to the legendary Saturday afternoon breaking sessions at Rock City in Nottingham, getting the true roots and foundation of hip-hop culture. I think the first 12\" I bought was Afrika Bamabaataa's 'Renegades of Funk'. This was the start of a serious habit, and by the late 80s I was getting the urge to DJ and make music, buying breaks, old funk and jazz records, working hard learning to mix and scratch, doing tapes for friends, spreading the word. This led indirectly to me doing a prime time show on Heatwave Radio, Nottingham's longest running pirate radio station. Through various hook-ups from the radio, I ended up doing some session scratching on tracks by K.I.D. for Kold Sweat, MSD, Docta D, and Tickle (now known as Frisco). After us hooking up that time, it turned out that me and Frisco both felt the same about the way the hip-hop scene was going, (downhill slowly), and we had both wasted a lot of years doing projects we weren't in control of: it was time to sort something out properly. So here we are: Lost Island.\"\n\n Frisco: \"Frisco Boogie aka Mr. Fivemics first started practicing the art of hip-hop through B-boying around 1983, after joining a local crew called 'Supreme Force'. We travelled around the country, performing and battling other crews. I started seriously MCing in about '89-90, and this led to me releasing a 12\" with a group called 'Solerco', which reached the semi-finals of the Sony Dance Music Championships in 1993 (!). I ended up doing another 12\" that year, 'Mr. Kinkleton', on Total Frequency Records. During this time I also played drums in various Nottingham funk bands.\n\n Frisco on hip-hop: to me, to quote a rhyme, 'Its an artform born from the torn shreds of ghetto life.' Its a way of expression, whether its positive or negative, everybody has something to say. But most of all its a battle: if you're a B-boy, its about busting a move harder than the next man, making the next man think \"I can't compete with that!\" or having the style to carry off the simplest move and make it look amazing. But when it comes to the mic, its about who got the lines, the punchlines to stop you dead. Its about the artistic creation of lyrics, metaphors, word play, creating pictures from a jigsaw of spoken word. And for me, the rhymes I want to design need to stand the test of time, so in centuries to come my great-grandchildren will still be saying \"Great-grandad - he had the next level skilz!'''\n\n Since dropping their first 3 EP's on SON, Lost Island did shows from Nottingham to London to Europe, with a prime slot at the UK Fresh 99 hip-hop extravaganza (hosted by Styly Cee) supporting Jurassic 5, and Dilated Peoples. They later played alongside Rahzel (The Roots) and The Arsonists. Styly started expanding his production ventures, doing remixes for Quakes, and later hooking up with new Son signing, Cappo, as well as providing the supafat cut-up intro on the label\u2019s first compilation (\u2018Year One\u2019). With his production skills starting to get some recognition outside his hometown, by 1999 Echoes were already flagging him as a talent to watch, with his nomination as one of the top 10 UK producers in their end of year round-up. In the meantime, Frisco was getting his groove on with the side-projects, making tunes with I.G.OFF (DJ Spinna's associate) and dropping freestyles on stage alongside Supernatural.. 1999 also saw their tunes being picked up on for a well-received compilation of UK hip-hop ('Raw Materials') and Bomb Records' (the people behind the world famous 'Return of the DJ' series) 'Contents Under Pressure'.\n\n Having laid the foundation, the Notts veterans released their debut (and only) full-length, 'Forbidden Ground' in 2000.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lost+Island\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Deriving its name from a shortening of the word \"refugees\", the group consists of Wyclef Jean, Pras Michel, and Lauryn Hill. The group rose to prominence in the mid-1990s for their pioneering blend of reggae, R&B, funk and hip hop, which eschewed gangsta rap and made them one of the most significant alternative hip hop acts. They occasionally rapped in Haitian Creole, and were one of the first hip hop bands to incorporate live instrumentation during their performances, along with the Roots.\n\nIn 1993, the trio signed with Ruffhouse Records, an imprint of Columbia Records. Their debut album Blunted on Reality (1994), fused elements of political hip hop, jazz and neo soul. It was met with favorable reviews, and included the Salaam Remi-remixed underground hits \"Nappy Heads\" and \"Vocab\". According to The New York Times, the group's second studio album The Score (1996) placed them \"at the forefront of pop music\". The album peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200, and was certified 7\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It spawned the singles \"Ready or Not\", \"Fu-Gee-La\", and \"Killing Me Softly\". The latter single reached number one in over twenty countries worldwide. The Score was nominated at the Grammy Awards for Album of the Year. This marked the second time a rap album received a nomination for the award.\n\nAfterwards, the Fugees made an uncredited guest appearance on Simply Red's version of \"Angel\"; and released the single \"Rumble in the Jungle\" (featuring Busta Rhymes, A Tribe Called Quest & John Fort\u00e9), both of which peaked within the top five on the UK Singles Chart. Their 1997 performance in Haiti marked the largest staged concert ever held in the country. They also collaborated with Bounty Killer on the single \"Hip-Hopera\", which spent several weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The Fugees later disbanded due to internal conflict, leading each of the members to pursue solo careers. Since then, they have briefly reunited for live performances and reunion tours; most recently in 2023.\n\nTogether they have won two Grammy Awards, a Brit Award for International Group, and the Medal of Honor from Haitian President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val. They are one of the best-selling hip hop groups of all time, and were the second biggest R&B act worldwide after Michael Jackson in the 1990s. The Fugees were ranked as one of the greatest rap groups by MTV (2007) and Billboard (2023), and landed at number 17 on the '50 Greatest Hip-Hop Artists' list (2003) by VH1. The Score was listed among the 500 Greatest Albums by Rolling Stone.

In 1997, Defari teamed with producer-emcee Evidence of Dilated Peoples and dropped two highly regarded singles, \"Bionic b\/w Change & Switch\" and People's Choice b\/w Bottom Line on ABB Records. Defari gained notoriety and built a reputation as an artist whose music transcended regional barriers. In May of 1998, Defari signed with Tommy Boy Records. In doing so, he became one of the first participants in the West Coast's Hiphop renaissance to in effect \"graduate\". \n\n  \nFollowing the release of his debut album, Defari co-headlined with Xzibit & Phife (A Tribe Called Quest) on The Underdawgs of Hip Hop National Tour in April & May of 1999. He wasn't a newcomer when it came to performing live. Prior to this, he toured the underground circuit for years and received rave review for being one of the most charismatic emcees to hit the stage. His energetic and captivating performances led him to other national & international tours. Rocking a wide range of audiences with some of the major players of the game today. The most current recent N. American tour being the Anger Management Tour where he performed with Xzibit and performed his own material to 20,000 plus crowds each night. Many agree that Defari knows how to bring it like a true seasoned veteran. \n It came to the point in 2000 that the fans were not going to be satisfied with just the 12\u201d vinyl available from Defari. With ABB Records\u2019 new initiative into the European markets, they released their first ABB Europe CD: Defari\u2019s \u201cLA Collexion\u201d \u2013 a collection of all Defari\u2019s vinyl only singles on ABB Records for the first time on CD. The whole pressing was sold out in France alone within 2 days!  \nAn even more heightened profile in the US came after his featuring on Dr Dre\u2019s \u201cChronic 2001\u201d album and touring the world on the \u201cUp In Smoke Tour\u201d with Dre & Eminem. With fans around the world screaming for Defari to face them one to one in shows \u2013 Defari turned to Nicci Cheeks Management in the UK to formalise a new base for his operations outside of the USA, but this time for Europe.   \n High Times Records signed Defari for his 2003 sophomore album \u201cOdds & Evens\u201d featuring all the usual Likwit family: Dilated Peoples, Tha Liks (Tash, J-Ro & E-Swift) and the Barbershop MCs. This was an automatic VIP round trip ticket to the Amsterdam Cannabis Cup in 2002 and 2003, where Defari performed to a very packed out Melkweg every year alongside groups including: Tha Liks and De La Soul. The release of his new album coupled with a fantastic video for the single \u201cSpell My Name\u201d gave fuel to fire for his European management. This has resulted in a 300% increase in Defari\u2019s press, radio and TV coverage (including a special feature documentary about Defari on VIVA TV\u2019s \u201cMixery Raw Deluxe\u201d show during May 2004)\u2026 and ultimately his touring capabilities as a solo artist. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Defari\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., bassist Leonard Hubbardand keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album, He produced songs such as Still D.R.E. by Dr Dre. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix released in 1993, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with R'n'B singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"Break You Off\" (featuring Musiq Soulchild) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChestnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban\/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records.\n\nThe Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam.\n\nThe Roots next album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008. Features tracks with Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Saigon, and other greats.\n\nThe Make Me Songfacts reports that The Roots' eleventh album, undun, is their first concept album.

Because his mother's career required constant relocation, the family moved frequently and the soon-to-be rapper found solace within himself. His rhetorical abilities blossomed later, once hip-hop became the guiding force in his life. He began rhyming and in the mid-'90s joined a group called T.H.E.M. (The Heralds of Extreme Metaphors.)\n\nThis group consisted also of his partner Webb. Following a fallout with his partner, Canibus pursued a solo career and began infiltrating the mix-tape circuit. By 1997, he had approached the brink of the major-label rap game, guesting regularly on high-profile releases: He contributed to \"Uni-4-orm,\" an inclusion on the Rhyme & Reason soundtrack also featuring Heltah Skeltah and Rass Kass; \"Love, Peace & Nappiness,\" an inclusion on the Lost Boyz's Love, Peace & Nappiness also featuring Redman and A+; \"Making a Name for Ourselves,\" an inclusion on Common's One Day It'll All Make Sense; the non-album remix of Wyclef Jean's \"Gone Till November.\"\n\nAnd most famously, \"4, 3, 2, 1,\" an inclusion on LL Cool J's Phenomenon also featuring Redman, DMX, and Method Man.\n\nOf the several guest appearances, \"4, 3, 2, 1\" certainly meant the most, as it brought together many of New York's preeminent hardcore rappers and thus ushered Canibus into that same elite class. At the same time, however, Canibus lashed out shortly afterward with the Mike Tyson-featuring \"Second Round K.O.,\" where he rhymed, \"So I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine\/You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine.\" \n\nIn fact, the entirety of the song directed barbed rhymes at LL: \"You walk around showin' off your body cause it sells\/Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills\/Mad at me 'cause I kick that sh*t real niggaz feel\/While 99 percent of your fans wear high heels,\" and so on. Shortly thereafter, LL sought his revenge, releasing \"The Ripper Strikes Back\" on the Survival of the Illest soundtrack (1998) and thus channeling even more attention toward Canibus. \n\nFrom the track's chorus (\"Can-I-bus? Yes you can!\") to practically every line of the verses (\"You soft as a newborn baby takin' a nap\/Make my dick hard with that bitch-ass track\/Where you at? smokin' in some one-room flat\/Suckin' on Clef's dick hopin' to come back\"), LL unleashed a fury of insults and threats. The media, of course, elevated the battle to grand heights, as even MTV gave the story headlines. In the aftermath of 2Pac's and Biggie's deaths, such confrontations fascinated the rap community, and Canibus certainly capitalized on his newfound publicity.\n\nAs for his debut full-length, Can-i-bus (1998), though, the response was sobering. Critics expressed little support, and sales quickly dropped as listeners also felt genuinely disappointed. Executive produced by Wyclef, the album suffered on many levels, both production-wise and rhetorically as well (critics targeting Canibus' delivery more than his lyrics or themes). The momentum that \"Second Round K.O.\" had generated simmered almost immediately, and it didn't help that LL's \"Ripper Strikes Back\" found substantial acceptance at the time as well. \n\nIn the two years following the release of Can-i-bus, the rapper maintained an extremely low profile, much in contrast to the regular guest appearances he had made leading up to his debut. As a result, when he finally did return with his follow-up album, 2000 B.C. (2000), few noticed, it came and went generally unheard, and Canibus returned to the underground after parting ways with Universal. He continued to record albums and release them on the independent circuit (including 2002's Mic Club, 2003's Rip the Jacker, and 2005's Mind Control); furthermore, he retained a small base of fans as well, yet his days as the next-big-thing had clearly come and gone, as they similarly had for so many other talented rappers. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Canibus\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The group is composed of Willie \u201cSkoob\u201d Hines and Andre \u201cKrazy Drayz\u201d Weston. With their first album \u201cDead serious\u201d released in 1992, the group creates a mini-revolution by using an ultra-fast rap associated with funky beats. The album was a commercial success. The following year, Das EFX released their second LP \u201cStraight up Sewaside\", \u201cHold it down\u201d in 1995, and \u201cGeneration EFX\u201d in 1998. Their last album was \"How We Do\" which was released in 2003.  \n-----------\n Das EFX's wildly playful, rapid-fire stuttering -- dense with rhymes and nonsense words -- was one of the most distinctive and influential lyrical styles in early-'90s hip-hop. While the duo completely rewrote the MC rule book, they themselves were increasingly pegged as a one-dimensional novelty the longer their career progressed, despite watching elements of their style creep into countless rappers' bags of tricks. Krazy Drazyz (born Andre Weston; Teaneck, NJ) and Skoob (born Willie Hines) were both raised in Brooklyn, but didn't begin performing together until they met at Virginia State University in 1988. Removed from an active music scene, the two were free to develop their most idiosyncratic tendencies; they started making up gibberish words (anything ending in \"-iggity\" was a favorite) that added loads of extra syllables to their lines, and wove plenty of pop-cultural references into the tongue-twisting lyrical gymnastics that resulted. Das EFX caught their big break when they performed at a talent show judged by EPMD; though they didn't win, EPMD was impressed enough to offer them a deal, and the duo became part of the Hit Squad crew of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\n\nSigning to the East West label, Das EFX began work on their debut album, commuting between Virginia and New York and mailing tapes to EPMD (then touring the country) for guidance. Upon its release in 1992, Dead Serious caused an immediate sensation, and is still considered something of a landmark in hip-hop circles. The first single, the instantly memorable signature song \"They Want EFX,\" was a Top 40 pop hit and a Top Ten R&B hit, and helped push sales of Dead Serious past the platinum mark. Wary of being pigeonholed by repeating themselves, the duo slowed down their lyrical flow and downplayed the surrealistic side of their interplay on the follow-up album, 1993's Straight Up Sewaside, which went gold. Around the time of 1995's disappointing Hold It Down, Das EFX found themselves caught in the middle of EPMD's ugly breakup; it led to a three-year absence from recording. By the time they returned in 1998 with Generation EFX, the group was playing more to a devoted but narrower cult audience; they have remained largely silent since.

Appearing on the classic 1988 posse cut, The Symphony, he garnered notoriety as an unsung asset to the Juice Crew posse, and is therefore, widely considered one on the roster, where he released a number of well-respected albums that were nonetheless little-heard outside purist circles. The single that has earned him the most attention has been Jeep Ass Niguh (alternatively known as \"Born To Roll\", essentially a remix which uses the track from Def Jam artist Original Concept's \"Knowledge Me\").\n\nHis most recent (and reportedly final) solo album, A Long Hot Summer, gained considerable acclaim in 2004. He is currently in the hip hop group eMC, with Punchline, Wordsworth and Stricklin. They have a page at http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/emcthegroup.\n\nIn the early stages of his career, Masta Ace was very energetic (cf. \"Jeep Ass Niguh\", where, tongue-in-cheek, he taunts police officers for their knee-jerk predisposition to harass black youth on city streets.) He also recorded material with a six-member supporting entourage, Masta Ace Incorporated. In light of his newly claimed status as a veteran, he has gravitated toward an earnest, matter-of-fact plainspokenness in the new millennium. Many of the songs that have lent newfound heft to his reputation are simple, no-nonsense rumination on feelings and facts of urban American life, including \"Soda and Soap\", \"Brooklyn Masala\" (which highlights a budding romance between Ace and a lovely but reserved Pakistani Hindu immigrant), and \"Beautiful\".\n\n1988-1994\nAce made his recording debut as Master Ace on the classic hip-hop posse-cut \"The Symphony\", along with fellow Juice Crew members Craig G, Kool G Rap, and Big Daddy Kane, released on Marley Marl's In Control album. In Control also featured two lesser known Ace tracks \"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize\" and \"Simon Says\". His first solo single, \"Together\" b\/w \"Letter to the Better\", was released in 1989. He released his debut album, Take A Look Around, through Marl's Cold Chillin' label in 1990, featuring production from Marl and DJ Mister Cee. The album featured two minor hit singles in \"Music Man\" and \"Me & The Biz\", a track in which he impersonates fellow Juice Crew member Biz Markie. During the few years between his debut and his sophomore album, Ace began having bitter feelings toward the commercial state of hip hop music, feelings which ruled the content on his second release, 1993's Slaughtahouse, with the loose concept of the album seeing Ace taking the fake \"gangsta emcees\" to his \"Slaughtahouse\". The album featured Ace's new crew, Masta Ace Incorporated, which included Eyceurokk, Lord Digga, Paula Perry and R&B vocalist Leschea. The album sold moderately well, fueled by the singles \"SlaughtaHouse\", \"Saturday Nite Live\", \"Style Wars\" and \"Jeep Ass Niguh\". \"Jeep\" featured an unlisted remix titled \"Born to Roll\", which became a smash crossover single in 1994, peaking at #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Also in '94, Ace became a member of a temporary crew called the Crooklyn Dodgers, along with rap vet Special Ed and Black Moon's Buckshot, and recorded the title track for the soundtrack to Spike Lee's film Crooklyn. The song became Ace's second Hot 100 hit in 1994, peaking at #60 on the chart.\n\n1995-2000\nAce furthered his mainstream appeal in 1995, with his radio-friendly Sittin' On Chrome album. This effort was also released with the Masta Ace Incorporated crew, now also known as The I.N.C. The album was Ace's most commercially successful release, breaking into the Top 20 on Billboard's Top R&B\/Hip Hop Albums chart. Sittin' On Chrome included \"Born to Roll\", as well as two other Hot 100 hit singles, \"The I.N.C. Ride\" and \"Sittin' on Chrome\". In 1996, Ace split up with the I.N.C. crew and was largely missing from the hip hop scene over the next five years, save for a number of random vinyl singles. During his vinyl days, he bounced from a number of labels, releasing his \"Cars\" single on Tape Kingz Records, his \"Yeah Yeah Yeah\" and \"NFL\" singles on the Union Label, his \"NY Confidential\" single on Replay Records, his \"Express Delivery\" single on Three Sixty Records, his \"Spread It Out\/Hellbound\" single on Yosumi Records, his \"Conflict\" single on Mona Records, his \"Ghetto Like\" single on Fat Beats, his \"So Now U A MC\" single on Bad Magic Records, and his \"Brooklyn Blocks\" single on Buckshot's Duck Down Records.\n\n2001-present\nAce's \"Ghetto Like\" single led to a misunderstanding with an underground emcee named Boogieman, who released a somewhat similar single titled \"Ghetto Life\" not long before. He thought that Ace was \"biting\" his track and released a dis song toward Ace titled \"Just You Wait\". The dis led to a rap battle between the two at a Lyricist Lounge event, a battle that was won by Boogieman. Ace later claimed that he delivered his rhymes off the top of his head, while Boog was rapping previously written lyrics, a topic which he discusses on his scathing retaliation track \"Acknowledge\", aimed at Boogieman and the underground rap group the High & Mighty. \"Acknowledge\" was included on his fourth full length album, Disposable Arts, released in late 2001 through JCOR Records, six long years after his successful Sittin' On Chrome album. Disposable Arts became one of the most acclaimed underground hip-hop releases of 2001, beloved for its pure hip hop style and clever album concept, which served as a fictional story, chronicling Ace's time spent at a satirical rap school named the Institute of Disposable Arts. JCOR Records folded soon after the release, leaving it out-of-print, until being re-released in 2005 on Ace's self-established M3 label. The album closer, \"No Regrets\", led many fans to believe that it would be Ace's final album, because of the line \"I don't know if it's the end, but yo, it might be\". Ace killed the rumors by returning in 2004 with his fifth album A Long Hot Summer, another highly acclaimed effort. The story concept, similar to that on his last release, served as a prelude to the story told on Disposable Arts, chronicling the \"Long Hot Summer\" that led to his character's incarceration at the beginning of the Disposable Arts album. Rumors once again spread about a retirement, which were again killed, when Ace announced the formation of his new rap crew named eMC, including himself, Punchline, Wordsworth and his protege Stricklin. The crew plans to release a group album sometime in 2007.\n\nOpenness to collaborations\nIn large part, the creative company Masta Ace keeps is comprised of underground performers with whom he has developed a personal rapport. He commonly acknowledges his fan base outside of the United States, which is considerably larger than within, as in the final seconds of his song \"Good Ol' Love\". He has shown an openness to working with foreign-based producers, including Koolade of Croatia and DJ Serious of Canada. He also performed a guest rap for the British Acid jazz group Young Disciples for their debut album.\n\nIn Scandinavia, he recorded \"What Is It\" with Norwegian veteran producer Tommy Tee in 2003, for the soundtrack to the car racing game \"Midnight Club 2\", which also was featured on several European mixtapes.\n\nWithin the United States, he has worked with Jean Grae, 9th Wonder of Little Brother, DJ Spinna, DJ Premier, RJD2, Pete Rock, Domingo, Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest, and Kno of Cunninlynguists. Q-Tip enlisted him as a contributor to the original Crooklyn Dodgers track in 1992. The track spawned a follow-up in 1995, with a third projected for 2006, but neither Ace nor the other original contributors, Special Ed and the bellicose Buckshot (of Black Moon and Boot Camp Clik), were involved with them. Instead, the second Crooklyn Dodgers track was produced by DJ Premier and involved O.C., Chubb Rock and Jeru the Damaja, where the planned third installment is said to involve Mos Def, Jean Grae, and Memphis Bleek, with production courtesy of 9th Wonder.\n\nBy extending largesse to younger MCs even as he has been careful to solidify connections with the rap game's old guard, he has amassed a list of collaborators numbering over 60. The most notable of his collaborators have been Eminem (who has expressed ongoing admiration for his skills), Common (on the track \"Claimin' Respect\" as part of a trio called Boulevard Connection), Guru of Gang Starr, Edo G (the third member of Boulevard Connection, from Boston), Jean Grae, Saukrates, Young Zee, Big Noyd, Cella Dwellas, King Tee, Tonedeff, Rah Digga, Strick, Das Efx, Greg Nice and the Beatnuts. He devotes several lines of the track \"No Regrets\" to express goodwill and thanksgiving to the artists he has worked with, calling these opportunities some of the most valued blessings of his career. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Masta+Ace\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Both members are natives of Queensbridge, New York; located in Long Island City. They are perhaps most famous for their landmark album, The Infamous, and the accompanying hit single, Shook Ones Pt. II.\n\n1992\u20131994: Early Career\n\nProdigy and Havoc met one another while attending the prestigious High School of Art & Design in Manhattan. Coming from similar backgrounds, the duo broke into the rap game in 1992. Growing up in hostile environments that included the prevalence of poverty, drugs, and gang violence, Mobb Deep attempted to express their life experiences through rapping circa 1992. Before Havoc and P were known as Mobb Deep they were a couple of teenaged rappers known as Poetical Profits. The world first heard of them via the Source's Unsigned Hype column and this is the demo track that was quoted in that feature. The song would later see the light of day on their debut LP Juvenile Hell.\n\n\"Flavor 4 The Non Believers\" (demo version) They released their first album, Juvenille Hell, in 1993. At a time when East Coast hip hop was dominated by the jazziness of A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul, and the Afro-centric stylings of Brand Nubian and Public Enemy, their style of music eschewed the popular conscious hip hop of the time, and reflected the harsh climate of New York City in the late-1980s and early-1990s. Because both Prodigy and Havoc were still in their teens at the time of their debut, many were surprised by the violent nature of the album. Although the album was not well-received by the public, it displayed the raw talent of the duo; the unique chemistry of Prodigy's lyrical delivery combined with Havoc's melancholy beats. Through this unique style, the duo were signed by Loud Records, and began recording their sophomore album, The Infamous, in 1995, which would establish the duo in the Hardcore hip hop community.\n\n1995\u20132000: Rise to Success\n\nFollowing its release, The Infamous became perhaps one of the most influential hip hop albums of the East Coast hardcore rap genre. Still at a young age, the duo powered themselves to the top of the hardcore rap scene through their straight forward narration of street life. As with their first lyrical production, Mobb Deep portrayed the struggles of living in New York City's Queensbridge. Their production also was noticed as the beats were often hard hitting and direct, a testament to Havoc, who produced the duos' tracks almost exclusively throughout their careers. Furthermore, the hit single Shook Ones Pt. II, received acclaim as one of the greatest rap songs ever. Their third album, Hell On Earth was released in 1996, debuting at number six on the Billboard album chart. The album continued their portrayal of harsh street life, while further pushing them to the forefront of the hardcore rap scene, along with contemporary East Coast rappers such as Notorious B.I.G., The Wu-Tang Clan collective, Jay-Z, and fellow Queensbridge associate, Nas.\n\nIn 1999, the duo released the highly anticipated Murda Musik album. Despite extensive bootlegging (nearly thirty songs of unreleased material leaked onto the internet) and countless delays, the album debuted at number three on Billboard and quickly went platinum \u2014further highlighted by the popular single, Quiet Storm. Shortly afterwards, Prodigy released his long awaited solo album H.N.I.C (2000), in which the rapper collaborated with other artists and producers (including The Alchemist).\n\n2001\u20132004: Decline\n\nSome time after the release of Murda Muzik, rapper Jay-Z, spoke out against the duo, leading to an increase in publicity. At the Hot 97 Summer Jam show of 2001, Jay-Z performed the freestyle, \"Takeover\", which he later re-recorded for the The Blueprint LP, dissing Prodigy. He also revealed photographs allegedly of Prodigy wearing a dance leotard in 1988. Mobb Deep subsequently released Infamy in 2001. The album marked a major stylistic change that saw the duo move away from the raw, minimalist, stripped-down beats of their hardcore roots, towards more commercial fare with such songs as Hey Luv. This transition fostered accusations of \"selling out\" \u2014 upsetting many long-time fans who did not wish to see them veer away from their original style. Although this stylistic adjustment opened up Mobb's audience to a wider variety, many critics and fans credit Prodigy's feud with Jay-Z with damaging Mobb Deep's gangster image and record sales (most evident when comparing the platinum-selling Murda Muzik to Infamy barely reaching the gold status). Not to be fazed, Prodigy noted that his lifelong bout with sickle cell anemia and his beef with Jay-Z had changed his outlook.\n\nIn 2003, the group split with Loud Records and released The Murda Mixtape which proclaimed \"Free Agents\" on the cover, addressing the group's split with Loud and search for a new label. Jive Records signed the duo later in the year and subsequently released Amerikaz Nightmare in 2004, which was seen by the general rap audience as a weaker release by the two - resulting in poor sales and the subsequent dropping of the duo from Jive.\n\n2005\u20132017\n\nIn the spring of 2005, it was announced that the duo signed with G-Unit Records. This came as a surprise to many, as 50 Cent aimed a sly diss at them on the \"Piggy Bank\" track. The duo made it known that this was not the case as Havoc stated in an interview, \"Mobb Deep isn't gonna change and when we first got here 50 was like, 'Listen, I want y'all to keep doing what you been doing.' That's it.\" 50 Cent has a connection to the duo, as he grew up in nearby Jamaica, Queens and also has used Havoc as a producer for several different beats. The relationship became deeper than business as the Mobb and 50 Cent got tattoos to pledge their loyalty to each other. Prodigy has the words \"G-Unit\" tattooed on his right hand and 50 has \"Mobb Deep\" tattooed on his wrist. Upon signing to G-Unit, both Prodigy and Havoc were given new Porsches, for two artists who have received very little monetary compensation in the past.\n\nThey recorded their album, titled Blood Money which was released on May 2, 2006. The album featured G-Unit members 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, and Young Buck. This marks their seventh release and has vaulted the duo into the hip-hop spotlight. As one of the most recognized names in hip-hop at the time, it was expected for G-Unit to help Mobb Deep attract a new fanbase. As Havoc stated shortly after the deal, \u201cAs an artist, you want to be able to reach the furthest audience as you can. We put in hard work on our previous albums and still hit our core fan base. The difference this time around is that more people will hear this product this time.\u201d Despite this, many of the Mobb's longtime fans were skeptical as G-Unit is known for their mainstream crossover music, and feared that Mobb Deep will conform to this style. The album was released to mixed reception mainly from fans, regarding it as one of the duo's weakest albums.\n\nIn 2007, Prodigy was sentenced to serve three-and-a-half years in prison for illegal possession of a firearm. Originally facing a mandatory sentence of 15 years in prison, Prodigy struck a deal with the prosecution, and pleaded guilty in exchange for the shorter prison sentence. He would later be released from prison in March 2011, with Mobb Deep releasing their first official project in five years,  Black Cocaine, eight months later. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of their 1995 album The Infamous, the duo released their final album The Infamous Mobb Deep in 2014, featuring a second disc of unreleased songs and remixes from the 1994-95 sessions of The Infamous. They would also put out their overall final project, an EP called Survival of the Fittest in 2015, which featured an all new ESPN remix of the classic 1995 single as well as a few brand new songs.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, Prodigy died at the Spring Valley Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, due to complications related to his sickle-cell anemia.\n\nTechnique\n\nEarly on, Mobb Deep gained their critical acclaim for a dark, dynamic, grimey sound with haunting melodies--Havoc's production--that to many represented \"street\" in a way not done by many or any before. Additionally, Prodigy's penchant for starting off a verse with an attention-grabbing line, writing compelling rhymes based heavily on Queensbridge slang, and a rambling but clear delivery appealed to fans on the lyrical aspect.\n\nFor some time, Prodigy was the star MC of the duo, Havoc sounding less focused on the lyrical aspect and more on production. This continued until The Alchemist was brought in to do a few beats for each album, after which Havoc seemed to begin concentrating more on his verbal prowess, slowly developing his own style. After the beef with Jay-Z, Prodigy changed his style, rhyming words less and slowing down his delivery, while Havoc increasingly contributed more to the rhyme end of the duo. After being on independant labels, such as LOUD, and then a larger label JIVE, styles from the grimy, gritty styles from the QB duo changed greatly, much to the despair of the mainstream fans, never fully recovering from the Jay-Z beef, they were forced into the limelight, and after releasing the street wood effort of Infamy, never reclaiming the status of the best kept secret. Signing with G-Unit seems to have worsened their career and Blood Money, their first album released on G-Unit, only sold approximately 110,000 in its first week, coming in at #3 on the Billboard 200.\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mobb+Deep\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

By 1995, however, membership slimmed to include only Mr. Voodoo, L-Swift and the newly-added A-Butta.\n\nThe trio's countless appearances on the NYC freestyle and mixtape circuits culminated with a record deal on the Tommy Boy Black sublabel and the release of the single \"2 Tons\" in 1999.

The original four members of the group are Imani (Emandu Wilcox), Slimkid3 (Trevant Hardson), Bootie Brown (Romye Robinson), and Fatlip (Derrick Stewart). DJ Mark Luv was the group's first disc jockey (DJ), followed by producer J-Swift and then J Dilla.\n\nThe group is perhaps best known for the hit singles \"Drop\", \"Passin' Me By\" and \"Runnin''\", as well as their first album, Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde. Pharcyde continues to tour and record, both collaboratively and in solo projects\u2014the most recent being Hardson's collaborative EP with the award-winning DJ Nu-Mark (of Jurassic 5) released in 2014 on Delicious Vinyl.\n\nPharcyde group members Slimkid3, Bootie Brown, and Imani met as dancers in the late 1980s and dancing was their main ambition as late as 1990. Around this time, Imani and Slimkid3 were in a group called \"As Is\" and later a group called the \"Play Brothers\", whilst Bootie Brown was a backup dancer for Fatlip (Fatlip being the last member to join the group). Bootie Brown recalls that their earlier dancing careers influenced their rapping \u2013 \"sometimes the way I rap is almost like the way I used to dance\". The group met Reggie Andrews, a local high-school music teacher who worked with the Dazz Band and Rick James, and who was a major musical influence on their debut album. The group also met producer J-Swift around this time, as he was Reggie Andrews's \"star pupil\" according to the book Check the Technique.\n\nThough Humboldt Beginnings is to date the last Pharcyde album, its members have since been keeping busy with various contributions and projects. A compilation of The Pharcyde was released in 2005, titled Sold My Soul: The Remix & Rarity Collection, featuring a number of remixes and rare songs. Former member Fatlip released his solo debut in 2005, titled The Loneliest Punk, and Tre Hardson's second full-length solo album SLIMKID3's Cafe was released on April 4, 2006. \n\n2012 saw the twentieth anniversary of The Pharcyde's debut Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde, and to mark the event Fatlip and SlimKid3 teamed up with the album's producers, J-Swift and L.A. Jay, as well as record label Delicious Vinyl, to play the album in its entirety at a tribute show at The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles. The performance was intended to be a one-off, but due to overwhelming success and reception, the group began touring the show 'Bizarre Ride Live', and, along with MC K-Natural, working on original music under the moniker The Bizarre Ride. In December of that year, The Pharcyde released the Amerigo Gazaway-produced \"Still Got Love (Bizarre Tribe Megamix)\" garnering significant praise. 2015 marked the twentieth anniversary of Labcabincalifornia, resulting in a similar tour through Europe and Japan. The group continued touring Europe through 2017. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Pharcyde\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Murray quickly established himself as one of the most creative lyricists in the industry with his first album The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World, released in 1994 on Jive Records.

Highly political, they fused left-wing, anarchist, anti-fascist views with punk vocals and the newly emerging techno sound that was called digital hardcore, which is a term Alec Empire later used in the name of his record company.\n\nAccording to Empire, \"Digital Hardcore initially meant the final questioning of everything, of the whole. The next step was a shorter one. The absolute negation, even to answer one's own existence with a \"No\". If \"No\" is true, then suicide can be as much as an event as pressing the buttons on your remote control.\" (MEAN Magazine, July 1999)\n\nThe group was founded as an attack on the increasingly neo-Nazi influenced German techno scene and consisted of three Berliners - Alec Empire, Hanin Elias and MC Carl Crack. ATR's early releases (which included songs like \"Hetzjagd Auf Nazis!\" \/ \"Hunt Down the Nazis!\") were surrounded by controversy in Germany due to the prevailing \"no politics on the dance floor\" attitude.\n\nAfter signing to Phonogram, a major European label, in 1993 the band received an unusually large financial advance which they duplicitously used to set up their own record label: Digital Hardcore Recordings or DHR. ATR never delivered a commercially viable demo to Phonogram.\n\nIn 1997 ATR was joined by Nic Endo, a Japanese-American noise\/soundscape artist during the Beck tour.\n\nIn 1999 ATR released 60 Second Wipe Out, an album that phased out all use of sampling and brought on board New York City rappers the Arsonists. According to Magnet Magazine, \"Empire's guitar-playing values speed-thrash malevolence, and when paired with Endo's painful skronkage, the album is decidedly denser than its predecessor.\"\n\nThe group decided to effectively disband in 2000 and to not consider the band's future until 2003. Carl Crack died a few months later of a drug overdose. His death caused Empire some anguish and made any reformation less likely. Since the collapse of ATR the surviving members have all pursued separate and successful careers. Nic Endo and Empire have collaborated since but relations between Elias and Empire appear to remain strained despite their mutual business interests. This is because, as she states in interviews, Hanin Elias decided to set up her own record label, where she did not feel oppressed by the mostly male artists. Her record label is named Fatal Recordings.\n\nIn March 2002, ATR's album Future of War (1997) was banned in Germany. According to Alec Empire, Future of War was noteworthy because of its \"left-rooted critique of the 'modern' high-tech-war, as we had seen it all some years previously during the Gulf War.\"\n\nIn July 3rd 2006, ATR released greatest hits compilation called Atari Teenage Riot (1992-2000). \n\nATR reformed in 2010 with CX Kidtronik joining the line-up for live dates and a single Activate! scheduled for release in May. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Atari+Teenage+Riot\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The son of jazz musician Olu Dara, he was raised in the infamous Queensbridge housing projects in Queensbridge, New York. According to the Nasty Songfacts, as a teenager rapper, Nasir  first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas. By the time he released his landmark solo debut album Illmatic in 1994, Jones was known as Nas. \n\nIllmatic was a critically acclaimed bestseller and is widely considered one of the greatest rap albums of all time. He married R&B singer Kelis in 2005, they have one son together, and she filed for divorce on the 29th of April 2009. Nas was also a part of hip hop supergroup The Firm, which released one album.\n\nIn the years following the release of Illmatic, Nas pursued a more commercial direction, which resulted in wider success but decreased artistic credibility among critics and hip-hop purists. Furthermore, Nas' increased commercial success was accompanied by stylistic changes that fostered accusations of \"selling out\". Nevertheless, the LP Stillmatic is often credited for restoring Nas' credibility among fans. Since the success of Stillmatic, Nas continues to maintain a high profile within the hip hop community, and has pursued a decidedly progressive and personal aesthetic. While Nas' current artistic direction differs greatly from his most successful work, it has ensured that he remains one of the most respected and acclaimed contemporary rappers.\n\n1973\u20131992: Childhood and early career\n\nNas was born in Brooklyn, New York, as the elder of Olu Dara and Fannie Ann Jones's two children; his brother Jabari (nicknamed \"Jungle\" because he was born in the Congo) is the younger of the two. The family lived for a time in Brooklyn, before moving to Queensbridge, the largest public housing project in the United States. Olu Dara left the household in 1986, when Nas was 13, and Ann Jones raised her two boys on her own. Nas dropped out of school in the eighth grade and began selling drugs on the streets of New York. He educated himself, reading about African culture and civilization, the Qur'an, the Bible and the Five Percent Nation. He also studied the origin of hip hop music, taping records that played on his local radio station. As a child, Nas had wanted to be an instrumentalist (at the age of three, Nas played his father's trumpet on the step of their Brooklyn home) and also a comic book artist. Shortly after his parents separated, Nas began to write short stories as he immersed himself deeper into hip-hop culture.\n\nBy his preteen years, he had settled on pursuing a career as a rapper, and as a teenager enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Willie \"Ill Will\" Graham as his DJ. Nas first went by the nickname Kid Wave before adopting his more commonly known alias of Nasty Nas. Nas and Graham soon met hip-hop producer and Flushing Queens resident Large Professor, who introduced Nas to his group, Main Source. In 1991, Nas made his on-record debut with a verse on \"Live at the BBQ\", from Main Source's LP Breaking Atoms. Despite the substantial buzz for Nas in the underground scene, the rapper was rejected by major labels and was not signed to a recording deal. Nas and Graham continued to work together, but their partnership was cut short when Graham was shot and killed by a gunman in Queensbridge on May 23, 1992.\n\n1992\u20131995: The recording and release of Illmatic\n\nIn mid-1992, Nas was approached by MC Serch of 3rd Bass, who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal with Columbia Records the same year. Nas made his solo debut on the single \"Halftime\" from Serch's soundtrack for the film Zebrahead. The single increased the buzz surrounding Nas and when MC Serch\u2019s solo album is released later in the year, Nas\u2019 standout appearance on \"Back To The Grill\" only intensified interest in his upcoming album, amid immense anticipation. Hailed as the second coming of Rakim, his rhyming skills attracted a significant amount of attention within the hip-hop community. However, many were concerned that Columbia, being a major label, would try to dilute his New York based style.\n\nIn 1994, Nas' debut album, Illmatic was finally released. Critically acclaimed and widely regarded as one of the premier rap albums ever created, Illmatic featured lyrics that portrayed stunning visual imagery and production courtesy of several producers . The album featured production from Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip (of A Tribe Called Quest) and DJ Premier, as well as guest appearances from Nas' friend AZ and his father Olu Dara on the song \"Life's a Bitch\", Illmatic was immediately hailed as a masterpiece by critics, and is still highly regarded as one of the definitive hip-hop albums of all time. Notable songs on the album included \"NY State of Mind\" (produced by Premier), \"The World Is Yours\" (produced by Pete Rock), \"One Love\" (produced by Q-Tip) and \"It Ain't Hard To Tell\" (produced by Large Professor and featuring a sample of \"Human Nature\" by Michael Jackson). However, due in part to extensive bootlegging, the record sales fell below expectations.\n\nFollowing Illmatic, Nas appeared on AZ's Doe Or Die album, and collaborated with his Queensbridge-associates, Mobb Deep, on their album, The Infamous. One notable achievement during this period was Nas' verse on \"Verbal Intercourse\" on Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. After this appearance, Nas received a Source Quotable as he had the distinction of being the only non-Wu-Tang Clan member to be featured on one of the group's solo albums.\n\n1996\u20131998: From It Was Written to The Firm\n\nColumbia began to press Nas to work towards more commercial topics like the rapper The Notorious B.I.G., who had become successful by releasing street singles that still retained pop-friendly appeal. Nas traded manager MC Serch for Steve Stoute, and began preparation for his second LP, It Was Written, consciously working towards a crossover-oriented sound. It Was Written, chiefly produced by Poke and Tone of Trackmasters Entertainment, was released during the summer of 1996. Two singles, \"If I Ruled The World (Imagine That)\" (featuring Lauryn Hill of The Fugees) and \"Street Dreams\" (a remix features R. Kelly) were instant hits. These songs were promoted by big-budget music videos directed by Hype Williams, making Nas a common name among mainstream hip-hop. Other notable tracks on the album included \"The Message\" and \"I Gave You Power,\" which tells a story from the perspective of a gun. It Was Written also featured the debut of The Firm, a supergroup consisting of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown, and Cormega. The album also introduced Nas's Mafioso-inspired character \"Nas Escobar\", who lived more of a Scarface\/Casino-esque lifestyle. On the other hand, Illmatic, which, while having numerous references to Tony Montana and the theatrical hit featuring Al Pacino, was more about Nas' life as a teenager in the projects, hustling and smoking marijuana.\n\nThe Firm signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment label, and began working on their debut album. Halfway through the production of the album, Cormega was fired from the group by Steve Stoute, who had unsuccessfully attempted to force Cormega to sign a deal with his management company. Cormega therefore became one of Nas' most vocal opponents, releasing a number of underground hip-hop singles dissing Nas, Stoute, and Nature, who was Cormega's replacement in The Firm. The Firm's The Album was finally released in 1997 to mixed reviews and lackluster sales and the members of the supergroup went their separate ways.\n\nAt about this time, Nas became a spokesperson for the Willie Esco urban clothing line, but had no other connection with the clothing line. He stopped promoting Willie Esco in 2000, dissatisfied with the company's operations. During the same period, Nas co-wrote and starred in Hype Williams' 1998 feature film Belly, which also featured DMX, Taral Hicks, and T-Boz of TLC among its cast.\n\n1998\u20132000: I Am... to Nastradamus\n\nIn 1998, Nas began work on a double album to be entitled I Am...The Autobiography, which he intended as the middle ground between the extremes of Illmatic and It Was Written. The album was completed in early 1999, and a music video was shot for its lead single, Nas Is Like, produced by DJ Premier and featuring vocal samples from \"It Ain't Hard to Tell\". However, much of the LP was leaked in MP3 format onto the Internet, and Nas and Stoute quickly recorded enough substitute material to constitute a single-disc release.\n\nThe second single for I Am was \"Hate Me Now,\" featuring Sean \"Puffy\" Combs (now \"Diddy\"), was used as an example by Nas' critics for moving towards commercial themes. Hype Williams shot an allegorical video for the single, which featured Nas and Puffy being crucified in a manner similar to Jesus; After the video was completed, Combs, a Catholic, requested his crucifixion scene be edited out of the video. However, the unedited copy of the \"Hate Me Now\" video made its way to MTV, and was premiered on April 15, 1999 on TRL. A furious Combs and his bodyguards allegedly made their way into Steve Stoute's office and assaulted him, at one point apparently hitting Stoute over the head with a champagne bottle. Stoute pressed charges, but he and Combs settled out-of-court that June.\n\nColumbia had scheduled to release the pirated material from I Am under the title Nastradamus during the latter half of 1999, but, at the last minute, decided Nas should record an entirely new album for release. Nastradamus was therefore rushed to meet a November release date. Though critics were not kind to the album, it did result in a minor hit, the Timbaland-produced \"You Owe Me,\" featuring R&B singer Ginuwine. The only pirated track from I Am... to make it onto Nastradamus was \"Project Windows,\" featuring Ronald Isley. A number of the other bootlegged tracks later made their way onto The Lost Tapes, a collection of underground Nas songs that was released by Columbia in September 2002. The collection saw decent sales and received glowing reviews.\n\n2000\u20132001: The Nas vs. Jay-Z rivalry and Stillmatic\n\nThe highly publicized rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z began as a rivalry between Nas and Jay-Z's protege, Memphis Bleek. On his debut album Coming of Age, Bleek made a song entitled \"Memphis Bleek Is\", which was similar in concept to Nas' single \"Nas is Like\". On the same album, Bleek recorded \"What You Think Of That\" featuring Bleek's mentor Jay-Z, which contains the refrain, \"I'ma ball 'til I fall\/what you think of that?\". In retaliation, \"Nastradamus\", the title track from Nas' second 1999 album, featured a reference to \"What You Think Of That\". The lyrics state, \"You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that\/You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat.\" Memphis Bleek perceived the reference on \"Nastradamus\" as a diss, and therefore dissed Nas on the lead single for his The Understanding LP, My Mind Right\".\n\nQB's Finest was a compilation album that featured Nas and a number of other rappers from Queensbridge, including Mobb Deep, Nature, Littles, The Bravehearts (which included Nas' younger brother Jungle among its members), and Cormega, who had briefly reconciled with Nas. The album also featured guest appearances from Queensbridge hip-hop legends Roxanne Shante, MC Shan, and Marley Marl. Shan and Marley Marl both appeared on the lead single \"Da Bridge 2001\", which was based on Shan & Marl's 1986 recording \"The Bridge\". \"Da Bridge 2001\" also featured a response from Nas to Memphis Bleek, in which Nas called out most of the Roc-A-Fella Records roster, including Bleek, Damon Dash, Beanie Sigel, and Jay-Z.\n\nJay-Z responded to Nas' songs with an onstage swipe during the 2001 Hot 97 Summer Jam concert in New York City, when he premiered his song \"Takeover.\" Initially, the song was to only be a Mobb Deep diss, only including one line about Nas near the end. Nevertheless, Nas recorded the \"Stillmatic Freestyle,\" an underground single which sampled Rakim and Eric B.'s \"Paid in Full\" beat, and attacked Jay-Z and his Roc-A-Fella label. On his 2001 album, The Blueprint, Jay-Z rewrote \"Takeover,\" dedicating half of the song to dissing Nas, claiming that he had a \"...one hot album every ten year average\" record (referring to Illmatic) that his flow was weak, and that he had fabricated his past as a hustler.\n\nNas responded with \"Ether\", the track begins with gunshots and a repeated, slowed-down sample of Tupac rapping \"Fuck Jay-Z.\" (taken from Tupac's \"Fuck Friends\") In \"Ether,\" Nas accuses Jay-Z of stealing (\"biting\") lyrics from The Notorious B.I.G. and brown-nosing Nas and other rappers for fame. Ether was included on Nas' fifth studio album, Stillmatic, released in December 2001. Stillmatic managed to be not only a critically-acclaimed comeback album, but a commercial success as well, albeit not on the level of It Was Written and I Am...; the album debutted at #7 on the Billboard album charts and featured the singles \"Got Ur Self A...\" and \"One Mic.\" In terms of commercial success, Jay's The Blueprint was certified double-platinum, while Stillmatic went platinum.\n\nJay-Z responded to \"Ether\" with a freestyle entitled \"Supa Ugly.\" going into detail about how he had sex with Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas' daughter Destiny. Nas dismissed the track by claiming that he was no longer with Bryan during the time the affair took place. In a recent interview, however, New York radio station Hot 97 settled the battle taking votes comparing \"Ether\" and \"Supa Ugly,\" and Nas won with 58% while Jay-Z got 42% of the votes. By 2005, the two rappers had eventually ended their feud without violence or animosity. During Jay-Z's I Declare War - Power House concert, Jay-Z announced to the crowd, \"It's bigger than 'I Declare War'. Let's go, Esco!\" Nas then joined Jay-Z onstage, and the two then performed \"Dead Presidents\" together, which Jay-Z had sampled from Nas' song \"The World is Yours.\"\n\n2002\u2013Present: From God's Son to Street's Disciple and beyond\n\nIn December 2002, Nas released the God's Son album. and its lead single, \"Made You Look\". The album debuted at #18 on the Billboard charts despite widespread internet bootlegging. Time Magazine named his album best hip-hop album of the year. Vibe Magazine gave it 4 stars and The Source gave it 4 mics. The second single, the inspirational \"I Can\", which reworked elements from Beethoven's \"Fur Elise\", became Nas' biggest hit to date during the spring and summer of 2003, garnering substantial radio airplay on urban, rhythmic, and top 40 radio stations, as well as on the MTV and VH1 music video networks. God's Son also includes several songs dedicated to memory of Nas' mother, who died of cancer in 2002. In 2003, Nas was featured on the Korn song \"Play Me\", from Ko\u042fn's Take a Look in the Mirror LP.\n\nNas released his seventh studio album, the critically acclaimed double-disc Street's Disciple, on November 30, 2004. The album's first singles were \"Thief's Theme\" and \"Bridging the Gap\", which features his father Olu Dara on vocals. The album also includes \"These are Our Heroes\", which accuses prominent sports stars and actors such as Kobe Bryant, Lenny Henry, Tiger Woods, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. of neglecting their heritage and background in favour of white values. The videos for \"Bridging the Gap\" and \"Just A Moment\" received moderate airplay on MTV and BET. Although the album went platinum, its commercial profile was relatively low compared to the rapper's previous releases.\n\nNas was featured on Kanye West's album Late Registration on a song titled \"We Major\". West said the song was Jay-Z's favorite on the album, but West was unable to get Jay-Z to record a vocal for the final mix of the song. He also appeared on Damian Marley's song \"Road to Zion\" (which also featured newcomer The Game in the video, widening Nas' still growing universally appreciated raps) and several other songs such as \"Death Anniversary\" and \"It Wasn't You\" (featuring Lauryn Hill). In addition, Nas was most recently married to the R&B singer Kelis, who is mostly known for her work internationally, but nonetheless released great hits in the U.S. The couple wed on Jan. 8, 2005 in Atlanta, GA, after a two-year engagement.\n\nDuring this time, Nas announced that his next album would be entirely self-produced and feature no other rappers, and would be titled Nasir, and later that the project would feature other producers after all and would be called Nasdaq: Dow Jones. Neither of these albums ever materialized.\n\nAt a free concert in Central Park, New York, Nas made a statement regarding the quality of 50 Cent's music. \"this is the real shit, not that 50 Cent shit!\" In response, 50 Cent included a stab at Nas by speaking negatively of his wife Kelis on his single \"Piggy Bank,\" implying that Kelis was promiscuous and calling Nas a \"sucker for love.\" Nas was quoted as saying that he feels no obligation to retaliate, remarking \"[50 has] got a good five to six more albums before I can really respond to him.\" Nas eventually decided to retaliate, and in July 2005 released \"Don't Body Ya Self (MC Burial)\", a song which taunts 50 Cent and his G-Unit crew, stating that 50 was \"a sucka for death if I'm a sucka for love.\" However, despite all of this, Nas still claims to \"have a lot of love towards 50,\" claiming 50 didn't understand his moves when they both were together at Columbia Records.\n\nIn January 2006, Nas signed a label deal with Jay-Z's Def Jam, further emphasizing the Jay-Z\/Nas truce and raising expectations for a collaboration even higher. His album due in fall of 2006 will come out in a joint deal with this imprint and Columbia Records. He recently announced to MTV News that his album is to be named, \"Hip Hop is Dead...the N,\" the N being a play on the word the \"end.\" The title is supposed to reflect what some would term the current low quality of rap music. The highly anticipated album is due out in December 19th, 2006.\n\nMusical style and Technique\n\nNas has long been famed for his creativity and storytelling prowess, which has earned him acclaim from both the hip-hop community and critics. In his early stages, from his first appearance on the Main Source's Breaking Atoms and throughout the recording of Illmatic, he was perhaps best known for his street-oriented topics, complex lyrical schemes (which often incorporated multi-syllabic internal rhymes), and witty phrasing and imagery. As he progressed and matured, Nas began to branch out into different subjects and developed a richer voice and slower rapping technique.\n\nFollowing Illmatic's release, Nas developed a penchant for hyper-visual storytelling and topical creativity. For instance, \"Undying Love\" (featured on I Am...) is a tale of his wife's betrayal told in first person, \"Rewind\" (featured on Stillmatic) is a narrative in which a story is recited backwards, while on \"I Gave You Power\" (featured on It Was Written), Nas assumes the role of a gun who recounts brutal tales of murder and violence. Over the years Nas' style has changed significantly. In contrast to his previous work, Nas\u2019 most recent material is distinctively socially aware and often politically inflammatory. Songs such as \"I Can\" (featured on God's Son) convey moral messages of black youth empowerment, while \"These Are Our Heroes (Coon Picnic)\" accuses several African-American celebrities of being Uncle Toms. Furthermore, controversial songs such as \"My Country\" and \"A Message to the Feds (Fuck The Police II)\" (which are featured on Stillmatic and Street's Disciple, respectively) question the conduct of the American government. Nas' views in his lyrics throughout his career have made references to Islam and the Five Percent Nation.. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nas\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The album generated the minor hit \"Scuffin' Those Knees\". After the release of their first album, the group was subsequently mentored by fellow New Jersey native Queen Latifah and consequently changed their name.\n\nTheir first hit as Naughty By Nature was a track titled \"O.P.P.\" (\"Other People's Parts\"), which sampled the The Jackson 5's hit \"ABC\" and was released in 1991 on their self-titled debut album. The album also generated another hit titled \"Ghetto Bastard\" (the track is often referred to as \"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\"). Fellow New Jersey native Tony D, accused Naughty by Nature of stealing a sample from his breakbeat album Music Makes You Move and using it on their track \"O.P.P.\". The matter was settled out of court. Later they had multiple hits from their third and fourth albums, titled 19 Naughty III and Poverty's Paradise respectively.\n\n\"Hip Hop Hooray\" was a success from the album 19 Naughty III. Its video was directed by Spike Lee and featured other hip-hop artists popular in the early 1990's, including Queen Latifah, Eazy-E, and Kris Kross.\n\nThe group also scored a major hit with the track \"Uptown Anthem\", from the soundtrack to the 2Pac movie Juice.\n\nIn later years, Naughty by Nature started their own music imprint, Illtown Records, and released an album from their proteges the Rottin Razkals. The group (mainly Kaygee) worked closely with a number of rnb groups over the years particularly Zhan\u00e9 and Next.\n\nAn ongoing dispute between Kaygee and Treach saw Kaygee leave Naughty by Nature in late 2000 to concentrate on his Divine Mill label. The remainder of the group released an album in 2002 titled IIcons, using a variety of different producers including Da Beatminerz - the album however received a lukewarm reception from the public. Treach is rumoured to be releasing a solo album soon. Kaygee has been extremely successful building his Divine Mill imprint with 2 platinum plus albums on both (Divine Mill acts) Jaheim and Next as well as songs on albums from Syleena Johnson and Charlie Wilson among others. In May 2006 Kay Gee reunited with Treach and Naughty by Nature at a concert at B.B. King's nightclub.

He began his career in the group Cash Money Click and released his debut solo album, Venni Vetti Vecci, in 1999. He has since released 2000's Rule 3:36, 2001's Pain Is Love, 2002's The Last Temptation, 2003's Blood in My Eye and 2004's R.U.L.E.

Ja Rule has beefed with rappers DMX, 50 Cent, The Game, Busta Rhymes, Dr. Dre, and Eminem.\n\nEarly life:\n\nHe attended Junior High School in Floral Park, New York, where he met his future wife Aisha Murray and they graduated in 1991. They attended Martin Van Buren High School together but he did not graduate. When Atkins was five years old, his sister died from respiratory problems. Growing up in a strict religious home, Atkin's family did not celebrate birthdays and Christmas, and as a child, was not allowed to listen to rap music. When he first heard it, he decided to be a rapper. He would sneak the music into his house and played it on his CD player when his mother wasn't around. Atkins is married to his high school sweetheart, Aisha Atkins n\u00e9e Murray.They have three children: Brittney (11), Jeffrey Junior (6) and Jordan (3).He and his family live in a mansion in New Jersey.\n\nRise to Fame:\n\nAt age 15, Atkins appeared with 0-1 and Chris Black as part of Cash Money Click. This would lead to him being signed by TVT Records in 1994. He would end up being heard by a young DJ who called himself DJ Irv, then later Irv Gotti. Gotti, was a friend of Jay-Z's and he was also a DJ for Def Jam Recordings. During the mid 90s his main priority was meeting Ja Rule. He wanted to sign Ja to his new label Murder Inc. Records. He wanted Ja because of his distinct deep voice. After Irv was able to sign Ja along with DMX and Jay-Z to Def Jam. He began to have an idea that they all work together. They formed a group named The Murderers. They recorded many songs together. Friction tore the group apart, DMX, a rapper that sounds very similar to Ja accused him of trying to steal his style with the deep voice, by saying that before the three were signed Ja tried to make his voice sound lighter but heard him embrace the deep voice and tried to imitate it. They had planned to release an album together, but this idea was scrapped and they all made appearances on their respective albums. Still, around this time, Ja Rule was still fairly unknown. Jay-Z, at the time a young star and new to Def Jam, was the most popular rapper in hip hop. Russell Simmons had the idea that in order to build hype around Ja Rule and capitalize on Jay's popularity that Ja Rule do a verse on Jay-Z's 1998 single Can I Get A..., which also featured Amil. Ja's performance of the verse made him a household name and he became an instant star and by the release of his album a year later he was one of Def Jam Recordings premier acts. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ja+Rule\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Busta just came up to him like, \"Are you Johnny Juice?\" and Johnny answered like \"Yeah.\" and he said he wanted to be down with this crew. He started poppin' and Johnny said he was dope so he said \"We're about to do this contest\" and they wanted to put him down with them, but he didn't know the routines. But they put him down anyways and they lost the contest because they didn't know where to put him in the routine. The next contest they had was more of a battle, for the crown of best b-boys in Long Island and they had their crew there and they won. Busta destroyed these other guys, when he was poppin. Johnny Juice says \"even if you listen to his rhymes now, you can tell by the way he rhymes and the way he moves around he's really dope on the popping shit\".\n\nBefore his leap to stardom, Rhymes, was a rambunctious middle-class kid from Long Island who wrote \"rap poetry\" and dropped out of high school to pursue a music career. \"I really thought he'd be a dancer,\" says his mother, Geraldine Green. \"At family cookouts he would win all the dance contests. He was always a showman.\" He reminds his worst job: \u201cI used to work as a stock boy at a department store called Cheap John\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew that I couldn\u2019t really wrap my head around doing that kind of work. Even if your heart is not in something, your mind has to at least be able to be willing to do it. So, I took the job and I worked for about two weeks, and then I quit.\u201d Why?\n\u201cThey just had me doing too much. I had to line up the roach sprays on the shelves and make sure they were all in order, facing the same way, with the logos facing the front. The dishwashing liquids, the detergents, the boxes that they came in when they came from the actual shipping companies that they were manufactured at. After I lined them up on the shelves, I had to cut up the cardboard boxes, fold them up neatly and tie them up so that they could do the recycling thing with them. After a couple paper cuts too many, and hands that were calloused and ashy and bruised, I said \u2018this is definitely not the thing for me to continue to be doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nBusta adds, \u201cI used that as inspiration to go into the studio all the time when I had a free moment. After work, during my lunch break, traveling back and forth to work \u2026 to just apply myself creatively, and the opportunity finally came one day when I was downtown.\u201d At 17, Rhymes landed a six-figure record deal.\n\nLONS signing with Elektra\n\nHis first name as a rapper was Chill-o-ski, but he thought it was a corny name, and Chuck D from Public Enemy gave him a new name, Busta Rhymes. He got the name from an american football player from the eighties, George \"Buster\" Rhymes, and people always asked him to \"Bust-a-rhyme\", so the choice was easy. In the end of the eighties he met Charlie Brown at Turtlehook Middle School and they formed Leaders of the New School with Dinco \"The rhyme scientist\" D and Milo In De Dance (aka The Cut Monitor). They were on Rush Management. They was signed to Elektra Records December 12th 1989. First Recorded Appearance: \u201cMt. Airy Groove\u201d from the Rubaiyat compilation, Elektra 1990. A&R Dante Ross heard about Leaders of the New School from Hank Shocklee [Bomb Squad] and Chuck D [Public Enemy] and them.He says \"I knew they were one of their burgeoning groups and I also knew they didn't have a record deal. I heard they were performing and I went to check them out. I had just got my A&R gig at Elektra. I went there, saw them perform, grabbed them right after the performance and told them they had a record deal if they wanted one. LONS released 2 albums, \"A future without a past\" in 1991, and \"T.I.M.E.\" in 1993. In 1992 Busta's girl was pregnant, but the baby died right after he was born, and Busta had big personal problems after that, but he got great support from his group members. In 93 they where divided because of ego in the group.\n\nA couple of other things that made him well known before his solo career was a couple of cameo performances, among them A Tribe Called Quest's remix of \"Scenario\" with Leaders Of The New School, and the \"Flava in ya ear remix\" with Craig Mack and Rampage.\n\nIt took Busta three years before he released an album for Elektra, in 1996 he released \"The Coming\" with the hits \"Woo hah! Got you all in check\" featuring Rampage and \"It's a party\" featuring Zhane. while recording his debut album, he left the studio to check on his new SUV. He'd recently purchased the Toyota Land Cruiser, a giant vehicle that gives the impression of driving on an elevated track, for $40,000. Rhymes took the elevator down and came out on Broadway, in lower Manhattan, at 11:30 p.m. His ride was gone. Furious, he marched back inside and closed the door in the recording booth. \"There was nothing I could do at that point, so I just vented that angry energy into three songs,\" he says. Woo-Hah!! Got You All in Check, one of the tracks he completed by morning, went on to become a street anthem and crossover hit, his first ever.\n\nThere was a short gap between the release of Busta\u2019s first album and his second album, but it came sooner than people imagined it to. Busta was sceptical about bootleggers copying the new album so for reviewing purposes he only sent out album samplers. In 1997 he released his second album, \"When Disaster Strikes\", and after that, his popularity exploded. 1998 became a very good year for Busta, he started his own clothing line, BUSHI designs, and released his third album \"Extinction Level Event (The final world front)\" and Flipmode Squad's debut \"The Imperial\". Flipmode Squad at that point included Busta Rhymes, Rah Digga, Spliff Star, Rampage, Baby Sham & Lord Have Mercy. \n\n1999 became a year with problems for Busta, he had to visit the courthouse a couple of times because of child support, and police stopped his car and found an unregistered gun. He lost the case about child support, and he got a 5 year probation for the other case. Now Elektra started to shut him down with less studio time and promotion for his next album. Busta didn't like that, and took his squad over to J Records in 2001 after his fourth release in 2000, \"Anarchy\".\n\nJ Records\n\nHis first album at J was \"Genesis\", with the hits \"What it is\" featuring Kelis, \"Break ya neck\" & \"Pass the courvoiser part 2\" featuring Pharrell and P. Diddy. Now he is CEO for Flipmode Records. In november 2002 he released his most fervent album so far, \"It Ain't Safe No More\" with the singles \"Make it clap\" featuring Spliff Star, and a remix of it featuring Spliff Star and Sean Paul. Other achievements in 2002 was the movie roles he had in \"Halloween: Resurrection\" and \"Narc\". In 2003 his SUV was shot up with 6 bullets while he was in the Violator offices, that happened just a month after a couple of people shot inside their offices. The collaboration with Mariah Carey & Flipmode Squad named \"I know what you want\" on \"It ain't safe no more\" became Busta's biggest hit so far.\n\nAftermath\n\nIn February 2004, Flipmode Squad joined Aftermath Records, New members was added to the squad: M. Dollars, Labba and former Blackstreet Chauncey Black joined them. In March he got a six month probation sentence after pleading no contest to a charge that he assaulted a woman during a concert in Fall River, Massachusetts, in December 2002.\n\nIn November 2005 the first official single off the album \"Touch it\" was released to radio. The video premiered in December. He is now the father of four children (born in 93, 99, 00 and 02). In February, while making the second video for \"The Big Bang\"- the \"Touch it remix\" ft. Mary J. Blige, Missy, Rah Digga, Lloyd Banks, Papoose and DMX, one of his bodyguards, Israel Ramirez, who recently started working security for Busta as his jewelry handler, was shot and killed shortly after midnight outside of the Kiss The Cactus Production studio in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, NY. According to eyewitnesses, the shooting was a result of an argument that began inside the studio and continued outside.\n\nThe Aftermath chief Dr. Dre said before the release of The Big Bang that \u201dAll of sudden I\u2019m hearing people in the streets talking about hos Busta\u2019s back. In my mind, he never left, and that\u2019s why I wanted to fuck with in the first place. He\u2019s got that drive, and he never stops trying to top himself. Anybody who knows Busta knows that he\u2019s always gonna come with heat.\" His third video from \"The Big Bang\" was released 10th May, \"I love my bitch\". The video features actress Gabrielle Union and the Black Eyed Peas' Will.i.am, who produced the song, but Kelis who is featured on the song, was not in the video. The single also features Kelis, but she's not featured in the video. Also changed is his appearance, as he has cut off his trademark dreadlocks as part of a personal renewal. \"Eight years of court appearances later and I was awarded custody of my children,\" he explained. \"My hair was remindful of the unnecessary rocks in my career and life. So it was time to shed the locks... I've got my career and family right.\" \"The Big Bang\" was released 13th June. The fourth video was released in July, \"New York shit\" and the fitth video came out in August, \"In the ghetto\". The album was certified Gold in that month too. This month he was also charged with an assault after the Amsterjam Music Festival on Randalls Island, and he was ticketed after police saw him talking on his mobile while driving past a Manhattan police station.\n\nOn January 3rd 2007 he turned himself in to police custody after he allegedly attacking someone on Boxing Day. Lt. John Grimpel said a man told police that Rhymes, had punched and kicked him repeatedly after an argument over money. On May 3rd was arrested on a drunk driving charge by police in New York City. Officers stopped Rhymes at about 12:40 a.m. because the sport utility vehicle he was driving had overly tinted windows, officers then smelled alcohol on the rapper's breath and he was subsequently arrested. was released on $7,500 bail, set by Judge Tanya Kennedy. After a 8th May court appearance, he was free to drive. Rhymes' lawyer said a judge ruled against a prosecution motion to suspend the rapper's license following the driving-while-intoxicated arrest. He also turned down a plea deal that day that would have sent him to jail for one year, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.\n\nBus appeared in a Super Bowl finale commercial for Pepsi Max Diet in February. Busta Rhymes pleaded guilty on 23rd January to assault, two driving infractions and weapons possession, avoiding a trial and the yearlong prison sentence recommended by prosecutors. But Judge Larry Stevens disagreed with prosecutors that Rhymes deserved time behind bars. Instead, he sentenced him to three years' probation and 10 days of community service for beating a fan who reportedly spat on his car in August 2006, and then assaulting his driver, Larry Hackett, that December. Rhymes was also fined $1,250 for driving with a suspended license in 2006 and driving while intoxicated in 2007. \"I just want to say that I'm very grateful to the judge, I'm very grateful to the system. I believe in the system. It hasn't failed me personally yet,\" Rhymes, dressed in a crisp black pinstripe suit, said outside the courtroom.\n\"I'm just glad that all of this is finally behind me and I can go back to doing what I do best - making great music and great films and being a people person,\" he said.\n\nHis 8th solo album \"Blessed\" was set for a release in July 2008. First he called it \"When Hell Freeze Over\" then he changed it to \"Back On My B.S.\", a title Pharrell helped him come up with, last it was changed to \"Blessed\" in April 08. Rhymes was added to Projekt Revolution 2008 (summer tour), He was joining Linkin Park, Chris Cornell, The Bravery, and Ashes Divide on the main stage. After the first week of touring he had to leave the tour because of business matters; Late July he left Interscope, because they couldn't agree with Busta how to handle the final version of the album.\n\nMotown\n\nIn September 08 he his new deal was announced, with Motown\/Universal. He then re-titled his album to \"Back On My B.S.\" The first single was released in October 2008, called \"Arab Money\" featuring Ron Browz. 2 remix videos with different guests were later releases in February 09.

The two were heavily influenced by reggae and the punk scene that was sweeping the UK. After several abortive attempts to start bands, the turning point came in 1984 when John Griffiths was on vacation in New York City and was impressed by a group of youths he saw at a nightclub breakdancing, and the sounds of MC Red Alert.\n\nAfter returning to Wales, Griffiths fixed on the idea of marrying hip hop and far left politics with his native Welsh language. Llwybr Llaethog's debut album was an EP released in 1986 for the Welsh record label Anhrefn Records and entitled Dull Di Drais. The album combined Llwybr Llaethog's leftist political messages with what would become the band's trademark sound of turntable scratching, audio sampling, hip-hop, and cut-and-paste production. The band were also heavily promoted by British radio d-jay John Peel.\n\nThe band remains quite popular in their homeland and have garnered a cult following throughout Great Britain and as far afield as the USA, Canada, and Australia.\n\nTheir Official Website:\nhttp:\/\/uk.geocities.com\/llwybr_llaethog\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Llwybr+Llaethog\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

In late summer of 2007 he was approached by Serge Farinas (Simbelmyne, Amidst the Withering) and collaborations were initiated. Serge added additional rhythm, lead and acoustic guitars to the songs.\n\nAs on the first EP, Sebastian Gustafsson and Vidar Wetterhall were once again hired for bass guitar and vocal duties.

On this follow-up to the successful 2000 release \u201cThe Book of Daniel\u201d, Scarborough\u2019s Dan-e-o (whose name, contrary to popular belief, does NOT capitalize the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cO\u201d unless, of course, the entire name is written in caps) mixes elements of funk, soul, reggae and rock with heavy doses of street battle raps and conscious-minded lyricism. Touted as one of Canada\u2019s greatest lyricists ever, Dan-e-o is best known for his first single, \u201cDear Hip Hop\u201d, which was released on Beat Factory\u2019s RapEssentials Volume One album in 1996.\n\nSince then, Dan-e-o has helped to establish his crew Monolith as a Canadian favourite in the world of hip-hop. Among Monolith\u2019s members is the Juno nominated trio Irs (\u201cWelcome to Planet Irs\u201d) who produce and appear in \u201cStand Clear\u201d. In the summer of 2004, the LP\u2019s first single, \u201cT.N.T.\u201d charted on Canadian radio while its video rotated on MuchMusic, MuchVibe and MTV Canada. Next to burn up the same airwaves was the bouncy single and video \u201cFunkbox\u201d featuring future R&B diva, Chocolate Ty.\n\nJuno nominated DJ Serious (\u201cDim Sum\u201d) is also on board to produce the cuts \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d and \u201cAmazing\u201d featuring Juno winner Blessed (\u201cLove\u201d), adding elements of soul and reggae to this funk-filled LP. Popular Jamaican reggae artist (and Dan-e-o\u2019s distant cousin) Red Rat appears in the hot club banger \u201cKama Sutra\u201d, which is a huge party anthem for summer 2005. All cuts make \u201cSee No Evil, Hear No Evil\u201d an eclectic mix of beautiful and innovative music.\n\n\u201cThe negative images of violence, greed and \u2018pimpery\u2019 that clog the airwaves these days don\u2019t impress everybody\u201d, says Dan-e-o, \u201cMad hip-hop heads still just want to hear someone who can rap well, period\u201d. Saying that Dan-e-o \u2018raps well\u2019 is like claiming Michael Jordan did a pretty good job of playing basketball during his career. And Dan-e-o plans to take his career to new heights with his sophomore album \u201cSee No Evil, Hear No Evil\u201d.\n\nWhy \u201cSee No Evil, Hear No Evil\u201d? Dan-e-o explains the album\u2019s title: \u201cOur world and therefore, our entertainment is often corrupt. Mad kids be emulating what they see and hear all the time. All these so-called thug rappers are really just smart, rich, businessmen. Everything I say in my music is something I can honestly say I live. And it doesn\u2019t involve any portrayal of a negative, cruel or hurtful lifestyle. \u2018See No Evil, Hear No Evil\u2019\u2026 If you love good music, you\u2019ll love my music\u201d.\n\nThe LAST album from Dan-e-o, appropriately titled \u201cSpeak No Evil\u201d is also out now!! Available exclusively on the streets and online, this LP contains hot new remixes including \u201cKama Sutra (Reblaze!)\u201d and bangin\u2019 brand new cuts like \u201cChocolate Love\u201d.

The Oakland rapper first gained notoriety at age sixteen, when he dropped the pro-Black, anti-government classic, Ward of the State (1992.) Boasting fearless lyrics and a militant Islamic bent, the album identified Askari as an enemy of the establishment and an advocate for oppressed peoples everywhere. Unfortunately, Askari wasn\u2019t able to enjoy the project\u2019s success, as he caught a three-year bid immediately after its release.  It was a pattern that would repeat itself throughout the rapper\u2019s career: each highly-anticipated album seemed to bring with it another jail term, preventing Askari from gaining any momentum or expanding his core audience. The process has been so consistent that it\u2019s tempting to imagine a government conspiracy, especially given the inflammatory nature of songs like \u201cBetter Hide Tonight,\u201d \u201cPiggy Wiggy,\u201d and \u201c3 Strikes.\u201d Despite the many setbacks, Askari has never watered down his message, and he\u2019s now set to release his fourth album, The X Factor,with no legal troubles on the horizon. He remains defiantly unapologetic about his music. \u201cIt\u2019s so much truth that the Devil don\u2019t want people to have it,\u201d says Askari, \u201cso it\u2019s gon\u2019 raise a little tension. But they can\u2019t do nothing but bear witness to it, \u2018cause it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\nFor Askari X, \u201cthe truth\u201d is the doctrine of the Nation of Islam, as preached by founder W.D. Fard and his disciple, The Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Whilemany rappers have flirtedwith NOI principles throughout the years, Askari is truly dedicated, delivering his message of social revolution in a religious context that can be difficult for the average listener to comprehend. Nevertheless, at the core of Askari\u2019s lyrics is a call to action that resonates in and outside the Black Muslim community. Inspired by the African People\u2019s Socialist Party, Askari rides for his own revolutionary clique, the loosely-knit collective known as RBG, or Revolutionary Black Guerrillas. The group counts among its members such BayArea legends as KeakDa Sneak, Yukmouth and Dru Down, but perhaps its most famous supporters are Dead Prez, who have pushed the movement on a national level with albums like RBG: Revolutionary But Gangsta (2004). While RBG lacks the organization it once had, Askari promises there will be a resurgence. \u201cIt\u2019s about to be a roll call,\u201d says the rapper. \u201cThere\u2019s no confusion amongst the ranks; we just need to have a universal gathering.\u201d\nReleases:\nWard Of The State (12\") \t\tRighteous Records \t \nWard Of The State (CD) \t\tRighteous Records \t1992\nWard Of The State (LP) \t\tRighteous Records \t1992\nMessage To The Black Man (LP) \t\tSlow Motion Records \t1995\nMessage To The Black Man (CD) \t\tSlow Motion Records \t1996\nProduction:\nTurn Off The Radio: The Mixtape Vol. 2-Get Free Or Die Tryin' (CD) \tScared To Die \tLandspeed Records \t2003\nTurn Off The Radio: The Mixtape Vol. 2-Get Free Or Die Tryin' (LP) \tScared To Die \tLandspeed Records \t2003\nAppears On:\nOutta Control EP (12\") \tGotta Go \tDank Or Die Records \t1995\nOutta Control EP (CD) \tGotta Go \tDank Or Die Records \t1995\nOff Da Hook (LP) \tKill No Killers \tLoud Records \t1996\nYou Reap What You Sow (CD) \t\tTrigga Lock \t1996\nBosses Will Be Bosses (CD, Album) \tThinking Bout Home \tDank Or Die Records \t1999\nLead The Way (CD, Album) \tGet That Paper \tThump Records \t2000\nTracks Appear On:\nCell Block Compilation (CD, Comp) \tFucked In The Game \tCell Block Records, Priority Records \t1996\nInternational Blunt Funk Compilation (CD, Comp) \tPeckerwood, Peckerwood \tIn-A-Minute Records, Blunt Funk Records \t1997\nGhost Ridin' 101 (The Soundtrack) (CD, Comp) \tBurn \tThizz Entertainment \t2007 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Askari+X\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Memphis Bleek regularly came in contact with rap legends such as The Notorious B.I.G. and Jay-Z during his childhood, and has collaborated with artists such as Beanie Sigel, Ja Rule and Missy Elliott, among others. \"Memphis\" is an acronym for Making Easy Money Pimping Hoes In Style.\n\nEarly years\n\nMemphis \"One Hit Away\" Bleek's first mainstream rap vocals appeared on the Clark Kent produced song \"Coming of Age\", featured on Jay-Z's classic debut LP Reasonable Doubt. Shortly after, Bleek became the first artist signed to Roc-A-Fella Records.\n\n\"Coming of Age\", ironiclly, was also the title of Memphis' debut LP, which didn't create massive records sales and chart-topping singles as his labelmate and peers' albums had. The same was the case of his second LP, \"The Understanding\", and third, \"M.A.D.E\", though the latter spawned his largest amount of sales yet (900,000).\n\nGet Low label and rivalries\n\nIn the time between the releases of his second and third albums, Memphis Bleek started his own label, Get Low, which in turn led to the signing of former Junior MAFIA member Lil' Cease. The name of the label has sparked a hip-hop rivalry, or beef, between Memphis Bleek, JT tha Bigga Figga & The Game, the former of which built an independent record label with the same title.\n\nMemphis Bleek was also caught in the middle of the epic Jay-Z and Nas battle, in which Bleek gained a few enemies, most notably Nas and Mobb Deep. Despite boosting Jay-Z and Nas's careers, the beef did little to help Bleek gain any more popularity than he had already attained.\n\nLater years\n\nRemaining one hit away, on May 17, 2005, Bleek released his fourth album titled \"534\" , in reference to the building he & mentor Jay-Z grew up in, located in the Marcy housing projects of Brooklyn. However, like many of Bleeks previous releases the album suffered in sales, despite decent exposure of the Swizz Beatz produced single 'Like That'.\n\nIn fall 2005, Memphis Bleek told MTV that he was recording an album called \"The Process\", that he would describe as a make or break album, saying \"I want to do an album that's through the roof, I want to do a classic album. I feel that if this album I'm not recording is a classic, I'm not even gonna put it out. I have to do it bigger than anybody has ever done it. I have to make a good record this time, not just talking-junk records.\"The rapper has worked on the album since 2005 and during that time frame he would release the songs \"Hustla\", \"Get Ya Money Off\" and \"Let It Off\". During this time, he would also leave Roc-A-Fella after Jay-Z told him he could run his own company and had the proper distribution deals to do so. He found a new home in 2009 when he signed to Mass Appeal Entertainment which is where he will release his long anticipated album The Process is yet. \n\nAlbums\n1999: The Coming of Age [Certified: Gold]\n2001: The Understanding [Certified: Gold]\n2003: M.A.D.E.

He released his debut album, Ghetto Fabolous in 2001 and has since released 2003's Street Dreams, 2004's Real Talk and 2007's From Nothin' To Somethin', all of which have collectively sold over four million copies in the United States. His fourth studio album, Loso's Way, was released in July of 2009 and debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nIt takes talent to make the struggle to succeed seem effortless, but that is the gift that separates artists like Brooklyn's John Jackson, aka Fabolous, from the everyday MC. While most rappers spend more and more time convincing the masses of their \"hustle,\" Fabolous lets his work speak for his effort. With two platinum albums (2001's Ghetto Fabolous and 2003's Street Dreams) and one Gold (2004's Real Talk) to his credit, the veteran hitmaker still exudes a rookie-of-the year swagger. After recording for both Elektra and Atlantic Records, Fab is enjoying a home coming with the legendary Def Jam label. His first recorded song was \"If They Want It\" from DJ Clue's The Professional, which was released by Roc-A-Fella\/Def Jam in 1998.\n\n\"I had people in my corner already over there,\" Fab says of DJ Clue and A&R Skane, the Desert Storm duo who discovered Fabolous. \"So it wasn't like I was coming to a new neighborhood.\"\n\nWhile he doesn't site any one reason for his move, Fabolous has learned a lot from his time in the industry and is eager to capitalize on his experience. \"I haven't peaked yet,\" he explains. \"I was happy with the past records, but I have some adversity to learn off of for the future.\"\n\nIt's appropriate that Fabolous is getting a fresh start for his latest release because he wants From Nothin' to Somethin' to be a rebirth for his fans old and new. \"Everybody is trying to take what they have and make something more,\" says Fabolous, explaining the album's title. \"It's a new year, everybody's on their hustle, back in the gym and I'm trying to give them some inspiration. This is music to chase your money too, work out--motivation music.\n\nThe first single \"Make Me Better\" is produced by Grammy Award winning producer Timbaland and finds Fabolous doing what he does best; blending radio ready sound beds with clever and memorable lyrics. Rapping that he needs \"a Corretta Scott to make me King\" Fab picks up with his female fans where \"Baby\" left off. \"It's a great feel good record, it's got a lot of style to it,\" he says. \"I wanted a record that could show that I could touch different people with my music.\"\n\nAlready recognized for his hit-making ability, Fabolous is eager to show the diversity of his technique while staying true to his blueprint for success. On the cocky \"Make Money\" he cleverly borrows Notorious B.I.G's trademark chuckle to comment on the laugh-ability of his competition: \"these dudes is stand up rappers, hip-hop comedians, I start laughin as soon as I put your CD in.\" His wit and wordplay is not something he gets enough credit for, but the MC is confident people will come around. \"Certain people recognize it,\" he says, \"but its like they'll sing it in the shower, but they won't sing it outside. It's all good though. One of them days you gonna get drunk and start singing that song.\"\n\nEnlisting a whose-who list of guests that includes Akon, Young Jeezy, Ne-Yo and Junior Reed, Fabolous plays to a variety of audiences on this disc, but there is no mistaking that it's his show from beginning to end. The anthemic \"Brooklyn\" features a yet to be disclosed surprise guest and \"Change Up\" pairs Fab with singer, producer extraodinaire Akon helping him reflect on his life and career.\n\n\"Anytime you become a successful person, people may look at you and say you changed,\" explains Fabolous, who references the October 2006 shooting that took place outside of Justin's restaurant in the lyrics of the song. \"That record just talks about people changing as a person for money, how they carry themselves and treat other people. For me, I might have changed where I live or my number, but I haven't changed as a person\u2026I slid a line or two about what happened in October but I'm not coming out with a bullet proof vest or anything.\"\n\nThe playful \"Foggin Up The Windows,\" produced by Miami's The Runners, features R. Kelly's chopped and screwed vocals from his hit \"Ignition\" to prop up Fabolous' ode to parkin' lot pimpin' of the more carnal kind.\n\n\"I just took it back to trying to get some in the car,\" he says with a laugh. \"Everyone's either done it or tried to get some in the car. It may not have been the place of choice but everybody's had a hotel on wheels.\"\n\nOther rewind worthy tracks like \"Real Playa\" featuring Lloyd, \"Diamonds\" featuring Young Jeezy and the Just Blaze produced \"Back To School\" round out an impressive collection that makes From Nothin' to Somethin' worth the two-year wait. In his absence no artist has come close to matching his boyish charm, wit and unassuming cool both on and off the mic. With a new team and a pop of his collar Fabolous is indeed \"fresh to Def.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to bring good music back to the game,\" he says confidently. \"And anybody that's bringing good music, the hype is gonna follow them.\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Fabolous\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

His real name is Savas Yurderi.\n\nMusical career:\nSavas' career began with the recording Warum rappst du? (\"Why do you rap?\"). He gained attention with controversial lyrics in songs like Schwule Rapper (\"Gay Rappers\"), LMS (Lutsch mein' Schwanz, \"Suck my dick\"), and Pimplegioneah. Initially Savas rapped in English in groups like the Basic Elements. He became more successful in bands such as M.O.R. und Westberlin Maskulin together with the underground-rapper Taktloss. In 2001 he left his recording firm Put Da Needle To Da Records and the group M.O.R. itself because of personal and artistic differences.\n\nIn 2002 he released his first solo album Der beste Tag meines Lebens (The best day of my life) with his own recording company begun in the same year, Optik Records. He worked with many German and international artists including Azad, Curse, Moses Pelham, Samy Deluxe, RZA, J-Luv, Lumidee, Bligg, Jadakiss, Xavier Naidoo, and Smut Peddlers.\n\nWith his recording firm, he sought to build up and promote a number of artists, including for example Eko Fresh whom he discovered. Currently the following artists are under contract: DJ Nicon, Melbeatz, Ercandize, Caput, and Amar. The contract with the rapper SD ended because of musical differences and he left followed by his friend Spontan. At the moment Savas' little brother Sinan is also under contract.\n\nAt the end of 2004, Eko Fresh released the song Die Abrechnung in which he dissed Kool Savas. In February 2005, Kool Savas answered with the track Das Urteil (\"The judgement\"). The track was available for free download on the hip hop website Mzee.com and was accompanied by a video clip that was voted twenty times for first place on the MTV TRL charts.\n\nIn March 2005 he participated in an advertising campaign for the animals rights organization PETA in which he spoke against the consumption of meat.\n\nPrivate life:\nAs a baby Savas returned to Turkey with his family at one years old. His father was arrested for political activities, forcing his mother to return to Aachen. In 1987 the reunited family moved to Berlin where Savas first came in contact with rap music. In 1997, he acted in the film Geschwister \u2013 Kardesler in the role of Ahmed.\n\nHe lives with his long-time girlfriend Melbeatz (Melanie) in Heidelberg. The relationship is also one of artistic and business collaboration as she makes many of his beats. They also are both vegetarians. At the end of 2004, there was a rumor that they were no longer together. Savas responded in the song Was hab' ich dir angetan? (What did I do to you?) on the album ONE.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kool+Savas\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He has released several projects under the hip hop label Galapagos4, of which he is a founding member. He resides in Los Angeles, California although he launched his musical career within the underground hip hop scene of Chicago, IL. He is known also as Offwheezy.\n\nCareer\n\nOffwhyte's most recent release is Mainstay, his third full-length album, a work filled with charismatic philosophies, potent verbal imagery, and a wide range of musical styles.\n\nOffwhyte started performing in the late 1990s, spitting raps at hip hop parties and open mic poetry nights. He attended the University of Illinois at Chicago with his long-time friend Jeff Kuglich. There they met a graffiti writer and painter, JASH of Chicago\u2019s legendary DC5 crew. The three developed a friendship that would become the foundation of Galapagos4 records.\n\nSquints by Offwhyte was released in February 2000. It was the second CD on the fledgling Galapagos4 label. Urb Magazine hailed it as \"ingenius\" and the Village Voice described it as \u201cfree-floating intelligence\u201d. Hip hop heads took quick notice to Offwheezy\u2019s lyrical dexterity and untamed production skills. The classic CD has been repressed several times and is considered to be the album that broke the monotony of Chicago \"battle rap\" that was prominent in the scene at that time.\n\nHis second album, The Fifth Sun, was released in November 2002. The album was licensed for foreign distriubtion by British electronica label Peacefrog, and Galapagos4 followed its release with their first European tour. The Fifth Sun gained airplay on BBC Radio 1 and on many other radio stations across Europe.

In the 13+ years since his debut, Moka Only has released more than 40 albums, both solo and collaborative. He records under a variety of aliases, with the most popular being Ron Contour, Flow Torch and The Durable Mammal. He has been a contributing member of numerous groups and collectives, including Perfect Strangers, Code Name: Scorpion, Cryptic Souls Crew, The Dominant Mammals, City Planners, Nowfolk and Swollen Members, along with many others. Amongst all of that, Moka has worked with underground hip hop heroes like J Dilla, Aceyalone, OH NO, MF Doom, Buck 65, K-Os, Sixtoo and more. \n\nBut it all began rather humbly in his hometown of Victoria, BC, where Moka Only discovered hip hop culture at an early age, starting out as a graffiti artist before switching to rhyming at house parties and freestyling anywhere and everywhere alongside partner K-Prevail (recording together as Splitsphere). In 1994, Moka made the move to San Diego in order to further his rap career, creating a number of connections that he would later use to his advantage. Upon moving back to Canada in 1995 and taking up residence in Vancouver, Moka met Mad Child, and along with K-Prevail, now just Prevail, the three emcees founded Swollen Members one night at a Denny's, with Moka coining their multiple meaning name. However, a group dynamic was not for Moka and he soon moved on to a solo career. \n\nIn 1995, Moka Only started flooding the local scene with a myriad of music, quickly earning himself the nickname of \u201cThe Most Prolific\u201d by self-releasing cassettes on an almost seasonal basis, which led to a few vinyl releases and finally album deals with a variety of labels. All the while, Moka was building a name for himself as a strong and skillful emcee with down-to-earth subject matter ranging from hip hop to fashion, from food to travel, and from love to sex. Although best known for his rapping, Moka was also building his resume as a a quirky producer with a knack for mixing live and sampled instruments. While the majority of Moka's musical output has been self-produced, his beats are also sought after by a wide range of underground artists, including Buck 65, who used one of his beats for his new album, Dirtbike 1\/3. \n\nWith his solo career as both rapper and producer on the rise, Moka Only participated in a few collaborations with Swollen Members resulting in Moka rejoining the group for Monsters in the Closet, their 2002 collection of b-sides and rarities featuring three new songs. He remained on board for Heavy in 2003 but left again prior to the recording of Black Magic. Once again Moka had found himself confined as part of a group. \n\nHis time with Swollen Members, which also saw him signed to the Battle Axe label, resulted in three consecutive Junos, but it also meant a decrease in the amount of solo music from Moka. \u201cThe Most Prolific\u201d returned in 2005 beginning with the release of The Desired Effect, his Nettwerk debut that realized a much greater pop potential for Moka. Unhappy with the label interference, Moka released a Japan-only alternate version under the title Dirty Jazz that was more to his liking, marking Moka's return to releasing the nearly seasonal albums of gritty, underground jams he has always been known for through labels like Camobear, Legendary Entertainment and Urbnet, as well as an occasional one-off project for various other indie labels.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Moka+Only\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Prodigy worked as a solo artist since the early 2000s. He was born to parents of Ethiopian and Jamaican descent. Prodigy was born with sickle cell anemia and suffered from the disease throughout his life. Propelled to awareness partially by fellow Queens, New York rapper Nas, who took a similar approach lyrically on his championed \"Illmatic\" album from 1994, as well as with the aid of a successful single, \"Shook Ones Pt. 2,\" Mobb Deep suddenly found themselves developing a quickly growing cult. A year later, in 1996, Prodigy and Havoc released \"Hell on Earth\"; debuting at number six on SoundScan, the album found them fully realizing their approach, dropping both evocative beats and cinematic rhymes that communicated the dark side of New York's urban landscape. Thanks to a grim video for \"Hell on Earth (Front Lines)\" and theatrical Scarface-like photos inside the CD booklet picturing the duo with guns and a mound of cocaine, Mobb Deep had created an elaborate image for themselves that took hardcore gangsta rap to a new level for East Coast hip hop. Their next release, \"Murda Muzik\", was heavily bootlegged while still in its demo stage, leaking rough versions of the nearly 30 songs the duo had recorded onto the streets and over the internet.\n\nMonths after the bootlegs leaked and after several pushed-back street dates, \"Murda Muzik\" was formally released, debuting at number three on the Billboard charts and quickly going platinum on the strength of \"Quiet Storm,\" a song that epitomized the Mobb Deep style. The album was welcomed by critics, who again lauded the group's lucid cinematics, driven primarily by Havoc's production. In late 2000, Prodigy finally released his long-rumoured solo album, \"H.N.I.C.\", which saw the more lyrically gifted member of the group collaborating with outside producers such as The Alchemist and Rockwilder on tracks that didn't depart far from the trademark sullen Mobb Deep style. Their follow-up, \"Infamy\", was the duo\u2019s last album for Loud, distributed by Columbia Records and was, for some, a disappointment lyrically and musically, while others praised it as amongst the best rap albums of the year. Loud was absorbed by its new distributor shortly afterwards.\n\nMobb Deep then signed with Jive, under a unique deal that gave the duo its own imprint, Infamous Records, and released \"Amerika'z Nightmare\", a very uneven effort, which featured production by The Alchemist and Lil' Jon. However, despite a successful single that featured a Thomas Dolby sample. The duo was not happy with Jive, and were let go at its request. The duo took a hiatus afterwards and came back in 2006, signing to 50 Cent\u2019s Interscope\/Universal-distributed G-Unit imprint. Their well-hyped \"Blood Money\" was a failure from the money side when compared to fellow label mates like 50 Cent, Young Buck and Lloyd Banks. Some accused the duo of selling out, with their beats and rhymes not up-to-par with previous efforts on Loud.\n\nHe completed work on his third solo album \"H.N.I.C. Part 2\", which was previewed on his official mixtape \"The Return of the Mac\" on the independent label Koch Records. The mixtape single and mixtape video are called \"Mac 10 Handle,\" and it shows Prodigy once again reverting to his trademark braids that he had prior to the release of Mobb Deep's 2004 \"Amerika'z Nightmare\" album; different from the short fade he had from 2004 to 2006. \"H.N.I.C.

At home he\u2019d cut, chop, record, and tap; on campus he\u2019d pass his tapes along to local DJs and emcees that would stop by the station. jel\u2019s friend and radio partner Kevin Beacham introduced him to the hip-hop that came before, the secrets of the drum machine (i.e. how to cheat to 10-second sample time), and \u2014most importantly\u2014a certain nasaltoned Cincinnati rapper who went by the name of Dose One. The rest of jel\u2019s story is the beginning stages and steady fruition of an entire movement in sound. In 1996, he quit art school in favor of the chills. In 1998, his first collaborations with Dose saw the light of day (Hemispheres). In January of 1999, the debut themselves LP Them was finished, and by Spring of the same year, work would begin on the seminal Deep Puddle Dynamics project. And from that record\u2014which included jel and Dose One, Sole and Alias of Portland, Maine\u2019s Live Poets, and Slug from Atmosphere\u2014the concept of anticon (or the tag: anticon) was somewhere born.\n\nToday jel lives in the Oakland Bay Area with the same SP-1200 he purchased as a teen. They left the Midwest together in a concerted effort to defy genre with a collective of like-minded individuals and instruments. His crunchy punched-out beats and swells of low-bit atmospherics have become anticon trademarks, highly sought after by artists around the globe. jel was one of the first, if not the very first musician to use the a drum machine in live performance like a drum kit with little to no sequencing. Using the pads on the drum machine, jel plays each snare, bass kick, cymbal and loop with his fingers. And his raps ain\u2019t half bad either. To date, jel\u2019s list of collaborators includes Can\u2019s Malcolm Mooney, Stephanie Bohm from Ms. John Soda, Mike Patton, Wise Intelligent of Poor Righteous Teachers, Black Thought of the Roots, DJ Krush, Mr. Dibbs, Sage Francis, Atmosphere, and just about the entire anticon roster, naturally. \n\njel is currently a member of themselves (with Dose One and Dax Pierson), Subtle (a cello-drums-samplers-guitar-keyboards-winds and words sextet on Lex Records), and 13 & God (themselves and the Notwist). His second solo full-length is entitled Soft Money.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jel\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Discovered by 2 Live Crew's DJ\/producer Mr. Mixx at local a talent show, they quickly were signed to Luke Skyywalker Records and released their debut album \"2 Low Life Muthas\" produced by Mr. Mixx. The group briefly took the subtitle \"Baby 2 Live Crew\" as a way to market themselves. Upon release, they received most of their attention due to the Miami Bass club hit \"Dance All Night\", a track that stylistically did not match the album's thuggish content.\n\nDebonaire left the group to spearhead his NYC Hip-Hop inspired act, \"Home Team\". JT Money continued on as Poison Clan, releasing the album \"Poisionous Mentality\" in 1992. It was again the act's Miami Bass single, \"Shake Whatcha Mama Gave Ya\", that gained them the most attention during this time, thanks in part to production by Kenneth \"Devastator\" Terry. Unlike \"Dance All Night\", this single was a major hit outside of the Southern club scene, and more importantly, became a blueprint for Miami Bass inspired acts for nearly the remainder of the decade.\n\nSuccessive albums include 1993's \"Ruff Town Behavior\", and and 1995's \"Strait Zooism\", which maintained the act's core following, setting the climate for other Miami based thug rappers such as Trick Daddy. However, much like the bulk of the Luke Records roster, JT Money began quesioning the label's practices, including the amount of unpaid royalties to him. JT left the label and reemerged as a solo artist in the late 1990s. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Poison+Clan\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Working with Sacramento and Bay Area Rappers alike from a young age had some calling him a Bay Area Rapper, however Skanless was true to the streets that raised him and always called himself very distinctly a Sacramento Rapper.\n\nIn 1996, at 17 years old, Skanless signed with one of the hottest underground label at the time, 51\/50 Records and dropped his first album \"The Book of Skanless.\" Still considered one of the best Sacramento rap albums of all time, \"The Book of Skanless\" included songs featuring the likes of 11\/5 and Totally Insane and beats by Big Hollis. The album included the song \"Dirty Mackin\" which was featured on \"The Best of Sacramento\" album and the hit \"Ghetto Swang\" which received regular airtime on Sacramento's #1 rap station, 102.5.\n\nAfter splitting from 51\/50 Records and signing with Out of Bounds Entertainment, Skanless released his second album, \"In The End We Shall Repent,\" in 1999. The album again included many beats by Big Hollis but this time featured the likes of G-Menace. A few months later he began a West Coast Tour with several Out of Bound Entertainment Artists that included stops throughout California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, and Arizona. However by age of 19, Skanless had lived a life most would only ever know of through Hollywood's depiction of rough inner city streets and gang life and the very life experiences that helped make his music real, honest, and raw also brought his rapidly expanding music career to a screeching halt as he was sent to Susanville's California State Prison for gun and drug charges just before turning 20. Released nearly 5 years later, he spent another 5 years in and out of prison on additional drug charges and parole violations but finally got off of parole in June of 2009.\n\nSkanless is now focused completely on his music and has learned in the last few years how to adapt to the many changes rap has gone through since the late 90's while making music that stays true to his life story and unique personal style still loved by many. Skanless is currently working on a few Mixtapes with various other local artists as well as a new album, not yet titled. He is determined to show that he is not just an underground legend and still has the talent to be Sacramento's biggest rap star to date!\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Skanless\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Banking L-Fudge's popularity on Jedi Mind Trick's Superregular Records in 1998, Louis started gaining notoriety. He released a series of 12 inches  \"General Principal\" featuring J-Treds (with the widely favored B-side, \"Factotum\"), \"Loudmouth\" and \"Guilty As Charged\" while making connections with artists such as Jedi Mind Tricks (landing two guest spots on the now classic, \"Violent By Design\") as well as others. In early 2000, Louis released his first album, \"Music To Drink By\", largely composed of his 12 inch releases. His album garnered mild fanfare but his off-kilter flow and dynamics left him with a small fanbase. \n\nFrustrated, Louis Logic went back to the boards and started remodeling his lyrical style in favor of more complex multisyllable rhyme structure and darker humor, and lost some of his \"underground\" curtails. During this period Louis's releases became more sparse but cropped up lesser 12 inch releases such as in 2002 Cage & Copywrite b\/w Louis Logic b\/w Vakill & Juice - 'With Us b\/w Resume b\/w Urban Legend'. Meanwhile Louis's peer group changed slightly, instead of Vinnie Paz and the Jedi Mind Trick family Louis expanded to Celph Tilted, Majik Most and most importantly JJ Brown, a young up and coming producer with an ear for cheeky yet complex melodies more suited for Louis's new found humor. \n\nIn 2003, Louis Logic released Sin-A-Matic, which gained extremely high praise, and even as recently as March 2006 on Artofrhyme.com was refered to as \"maybe the best independent Hip Hop album in recent memory\" as well as earning him #10 on the top 15 albums of 2003 at Rapreviews.com.  \n\nHis new found style drew many comparisons to Eminem because of his rhyme structure and more notably his topics such as joking about abusing women, murder and among other inappropriate things. While Louis vocally sounds little like Marshall, Louis has always shown an affinity for Em's lyrical deterxity quoting him \"No need for alarm, just remain calm\" on Postal and even early in his career as \"I used to be a loudmouth\". The immediate comparison turns off some hip hoppers including his sometimes rap partner Apathy who surprised artofrhyme interviewer with his neglect to mention him in in an interview until asked about him. \"Louis...I don't have anything to do with Louis. He was always more Celph's friend, I never rocked that tight with him. He was cool at first because he was more of a hip-hop MC. Then he started to get a little funny throughout the years.\"  \n\nAside from comparisons, Louis Logic's complex witty lyrical flow has been the subject for internet message board arguments with fans often listing him as one of hip hop's best, sellout, stupid, genious and everything in-between. Louis even took time to mock the fickleness of hip hop fans who often are guilty of the \"indier than thou\" and too quick to assign labels to their music with Fair Weather Fan, as one of the unfortunate downsides of success in an indie market comes a level of increased critism.  Louis also mixes politics in music and most surprisingly shows a very high aptitude for relationships from a male persceptive with his Idiot Gear.\n\nDespite Louis's success on Sin-A-Matic, he mentioned that he couldn't make another album only to have it ignored by more major publications.\n\nLouis Logic in 2004 released along with partner in rhyme\/sound-a-like Jay Love, \"Odd Couple\" which had mixed reviews. \n\nIn December 2005, Louis got his break landing a record deal with Fat Beats along with JJ Brown for \"Misery Loves Comedy\" which was completed on February 10th and released June 13, 2006. Misery Loves Comedy made the rounds for reviews to a much wider audience as PopMatters, IGN, Okayplayer, HipHopDX, MVRemix and All Music Guide unlike his previous solo LPs, partly due to his new label and his previous Sin-A-Matic.  \n\nSonically JJ and Louis abandoned previous hip hopisms to make way for a cross over sound geared to fit topics of relationships, friends and drinking as opposed to battle raps and political statements that filled Sin-A-Matic; reflecting his departure with the Demigodz and newfound friendship with Travis from Gym Class Heroes.  The album received mostly positive reviews, but failed to live up to Sin-A-Matic as many reviewers cited JJ Brown's production as the weakest link. \n\nPost Misery Loves Comedy, Louis Logic has been working co-writing JJ Brown on his first solo LP to which Louis professes \"You guys will be surprised how much J. has learned about rapping in the last 6 months. The kid could outshine most of the guys making records that I hear. You'll see.\"  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/louis+logic\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

One of nine children to his mother \"Miss Ivy\" and father, owner of a small sound system, Rodney first picked up the mic as a deejay at nine years old.\nHe nearly lost his life to gun violence at 14, but thankfully fully recovered from the bystander assault and soon began his music career as Bounty Hunter. He joined neighborhood friends Nitty Kutchie and Boom Dandemite in seeking out opportunities in country as well as town, performing for Metromedia and Bodyguard, as well as other local area sound systems. It was during a chance meeting with brother of King Jammy, Uncle T, which would change his career forever.\n\nBounty's initial recordings were done by Uncle T, after Jammy himself was skeptical due to the violent nature of the tracks. Jammy eventually relented upon witnessing the rising popularity of the deejay.\nHis first hit record on the sound system circuit was Dub Fi Dub and other recordings with the King Jammys label were compiled into 1993's Jamaica's Most Wanted, later released as Roots, Reality and Culture. By 1993, now known internationally as Bounty Killer, Rodney was quickly becoming regarded as one of the fiercest and most lyrically gifted of the next generation of deejays. Hits such as Coppershot, Lodge, and Spy Fi Die quickly propelled Bounty to an upper-echelon deejay, and sound system dubplate favorite. \"Coppershot\" was actually a hit in New York before Jamaica, which left Bounty as personally indebted to the American city as much as his native Kingston. 1993 also brought the beginning of a long, on-and-off rivalry with Beenie Man, which culminated in a battle at Sting 1993, extended through the mid-90s and flared up again in the latter half of the following decade.\n\nBounty won the war at Sting 1993 and his legacy as dancehall superstar was cemented as a result. The mid-1990s brought hit after hit, such as Cellular Phone, Not Another Word, and Mama. The heated war-of-words with Beenie Man gave the world many popular tunes from each side, including Ask Fi War, Suspense, and War Beyond The Stars. \n\nThe mid-90s era culminated in the release of My Xperience in 1996. The most comercially successful album of Bounty's career, and widely considered one of the best dancehall albums of the decade, it mixed popular dancehall tracks, such as Living Dangerously featuring Barrington Levy and Fed Up, with hip-hop crossover duets featuring Jeru The Damaja, Raekwon and, most popularly, The Fugees.\nThe decade closed out with two more albums, Next Millenium, which featued more hip-hop guest combinations, and 5th Element, which returned to a more hardcore-dancehall style.\n\nBy the year 2000, Bounty Killer, along with Capleton, was still considered the top deejay in the business, particularly with the waning popularity (at the time) of Beenie Man, and refocused career path of Buju Banton. This was due as much to being the most in-demand artist for dubplate recordings by sound systems as to actual studio material.\nIn 2001, he was featured with No Doubt on their international hit Hey Baby, and appeared with the band for a pre-game performance at the 2002 NFL Super Bowl.\nIn 2002, Bounty released his most ambitious project since My Xperience, a double CD (released seperately), titled Ghetto Dictionary: The Mystery and Ghetto Dictionary: The Art of War. While not nearly the commercial success of My Xperience, underground sales were strong, and it featured the smash dancehall hit Sufferah.\n\nSince the Ghetto Dictionary project, Bounty Killer's influence has mostly been behind-the-scenes, working with young talent and bringing new dancehall reggae stars to the forefront. He has been credited with bolstering the careers of, among others, Elephant Man, Busy Signal, Wayne Marshall, Baby Cham, and Vybz Kartel.\nHe currently oversees a stable of artists known alternately as The Alliance and Gully, which includes Mavado and Aidonia. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bounty+Killer\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Everyone clicked, sharing an interest in organic hip-hop and live instrumentation, bonding musically as well as personally. \n\n\"We did some shows in Boston trying to get our name out,\" recounts Raashan. \"And then we decided to move out to Cali to record an album.\" \n\nAnd so, the group, then known as Mission: which at that time included Moe Pope (check Project Move), set out West. The trip to Cali proved to be an adventure in itself. An 18-wheeler totaled all of the group's instruments and the car they were driving. Once the group finally made it out west, they used the insurance money from the accident to put out a self-titled EP to get their name out. \n\nSoon after came their first full-length, called One. The album quickly established the group as subterranean scene stalwarts in the Bay Area hip hop community, where they were now located. After that, the group, who in 2003 changed their name to Crown City Rockers after Mission UK, (a British goth dance rock band) asked them to switch monikers, hit the studio hard recording countless songs, eventually placing 19 on their 2004 debut, Earthtones. \n\nThe group are currently (mid-2008) working on their third album. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Crown+City+Rockers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He first came to prominence in the early eighties as an MC on the South London reggae soundsystem Saxon Studio International. That has been at the forefront of the U.K. reggae dancehall scene for the past 25 years and helped launch the careers of artists such as Maxi Priest, Papa Levi and Smiley Culture.\n\nHe achieved his first national exposure on night time BBC Radio 1 in the mid 1980s, with the singles \"It's Good To Have The Feeling You're The Best\" and \"Complain Neighbour\" (on Greensleeves Records), before achieving a UK Top 40 hit in 1986 with \"Hello Darling\".\n\nTippa Irie was part of the new generation of British MCs who developed the 'Fast Talking' style chat which today can be heard in modern day rappers like Busta Rhymes. Tippa toured extensively with his friend and long-time sparring partner, Pato Banton, throughout the Eighties including an appearance at Jamaica's Reggae Sunsplash and their U.S. debut tours together. The U.K. DJ duo of Tippa Irie and Pato Banton had become one of the genres favourite combinations. As the Nineties began, the dynamic duo pursued their solo careers. Over a decade would pass before Tippa & Pato would reunite in the studio with legendary singing sensation Peter Spence to produce \"The Good Old Days\"--a track featured on Pato's 2000 Grammy-nominated 'Life is a Miracle' and Tippa's 'I Miss' tribute album to his late and <br>great sister\/MC Miss Irie.\n\nTippa Irie has produced fifteen albums to date and has a string of ..1 hit <br>songs to his credit including \"Hello Darling\", \"Raggamuffin Girl\" (featuring Peter Hunnigale), \"Stress\" (featuring Lloyd Brown), \"Superwoman\" (featuring Winsome), \"Baby I've Been Missing You\" (featuring Janet Lee Davis) and \"Shouting for the Gunners\"--a song originally recorded for the Arsenal Football Team which reached the Top 30 status on the British pop charts. Tippa's first album-'Is It Really Happening To Me' (1986), was followed by 'Two Sides of Tippa Irie' (1987). Soon thereafter 'JA To UK Clash' (1988) with Papa San was released for Fashion Records. Then came 'Original Raggamuffin' (1989) and 'New Decade' (1990), both for Island Records. Tippa then linked up with Rebel MC and his label, Tribal Bass, for the release of 'Done, Cook, and Curry'(1991) with Peter Hunnigale. 'A Me Dis'(1992, I.R.S.) was Tippa's long-awaited U.S. debut recording. His second U.S. release was 'Sapphire and Steel' (1993, I.R.S.) with Peter Spence. England's Mad Professor then produced 'Rebel on the Roots Corner' (1994) for RAS Records. Tippa's Best of compilation for Jammin Records was appropriately entitled 'Mr.Versatile'(1998) and featured five of Tippa's ..1 hits.\n\n'Divide & Rule'(2000) with Musical Sniper AKA Rappa Robert was produced for Music Avenue in Belgium. Resin Music released both 'I Miss'(2001) and 'Sign of the Times'(2003) in North America. 'Combinations'(2004) with Lloyd Brown was released in the UK on Discoflex Records. Tippa's latest offering is entitled 'Greatest Hits'(2005) on Sanctuary Records and it features six of his ..1 hit songs as well as many of his classic signature tunes.\n\nTo this day, Tippa Irie remains one of the most requested Reggae entertainers internationally. The surviving members of Sublime made sure their Long Beach Dub All Stars debut for Dreamworks Records had the necessary dancehall credentials by commissioning Tippa Irie to contribute \"Sensi\" on their 'Right Back'(1999) CD and be their special guest on their subsequent North American tour. In 2000 he was invited to \nsupport UB40 on their sold-out Labour of Love III UK tour. Later Tippa was called back in the studio with Long Beach Dub All Stars to record \"Life Goes On\" featuring Half Pint and Jurassic Five's Charli2na on LBDA's 'Wonders of the World'(2001) CD for Dreamworks Records. Impressed with Tippa's rapid-fire lyrical arsensal, Jurassic Five asked Tippa to record together and the end result was a wicked Tippa and Charli2na combination entitled \"The Struggle\". The rap world took notice and soon enough Tippa was once again summoned to record with some of the music industry's biggest stars. Most recently Tippa was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Rap Song category for his collaboration with Black Eyed Peas Will-I-Am on \"Hey Mama\", a track featured on the international chartbusting 'Elephunk'(2004) CD on A&M\/Interscope Records. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tippa+Irie\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Garnering occasional airplay on AOR radio stations, the band is best known for their 1981 hit single \"Nicole\".\n\nOn their album 'Second Season' (imge provided) ... With the success of their eponymous debut recording, Point Blank had a reasonable amount of momentum heading into the studio to record Second Season. But rather than rearrange or pepper things up a bit in the recording process, Point Blank pretty much stayed the same as they did for their first record: a five-piece (they ditched the keyboardist) writing songs around crunchy blues guitar riffs that resemble a hybrid of British hard rock (Zeppelin, Deep Purple) and Southern rock. As a result, there really isn't much improvement over the first album (save for the removal of the cheesy, pun-infected cover art, replaced by the lads in the band \"taking it easy\" in the backyard, complete with yellow sunlit soft-focus photography). It's not the worst album in the Point Blank catalog, but it certainly isn't the best. For die-hard fans and Southern rock fanatics only.

With strong air-play on AOR radio stations the track reached #20 on Billboard Magazine's Rock Tracks chart. Subsequently, Nicole was also released as a 45 RPM single and peaked inside the Top 40 at #39 on Billboard's Hot 100.

Everyone was playing hardcore, and so were we. But soon we\u2019ve realized that simply hardcore was not us, although we liked the energy that playing hardcore produces. So our music started to change. No one was talking about changes but our telepathy worked. We started to make more complex and more melodic rock\/metal songs, and the atmosphere in the band changed. Everybody started to behave more serious and more dedicated. We simply wanted to sound modern. At that point we\u2019ve realized that POINT BLANK was no more some adolescent joke. Everyone in the band had experience with other bands before we started playing, but nothing like this. This was it. When we started playing, we were like 2 and a half years locked up in our garage making music and searching for our own sound. We simply wanted to be ready before our first performance. We were, and still are convinced that live acts are the most important thing that builds the band character, despite the recording sessions. So the time for our first gig came\u2026Our first gig went the way every new band wanted, crowded, claustrophobic, and very hot.

Comprised of 6 emcees and one in house producer - Imperial, Trouble, Stump, Kidd, RPD, Jackal  and Pikihed - share a common goal and vision to be the voice of youth growing up in the inner city.

As artists, they all have distinctive lyrical styles and deliveries reminiscent of classic hip-hop groups like Wu-Tang & Boot Camp.   As a group, PB has performed alongside hip-hop legends such as Rakim , KRS-1 , Outkast and Mobb Deep .

After forming Tilt Rock Records, the group later re-named themselves to Point Blank, which represented their raw, to the point and bold attitude.     Their lyrics speak of racial profiling, single parent households, poverty, community programs, crime, drug addiction, crooked politicians, police and other social issues surrounding youth growing up in government housing.  \n\nMembers Trouble, Stump & Kidd are all brothers and Pikihed & RPD are also identical twins.   These family ties have instilled a strong sense of family values and loyalty within the group.    It has also bred a strong desire to see their families enjoy better living conditions and prosper .  \n\nIn 1996 Point Blank released \" Retaliation \" on DJ X's Power Move Show (CKLN 88.1FM) Demo Battle, and received their first public appraisal. Shortly after, they were featured on Muchmusic's \"Soul in The city\" program.

Point Blank moved to Atlanta, where they resided with Andre Rison and the late Left Eye Lopez the group recorded several singles and shared stages with remarkable groups like Outcast. In 1997 Point Blank dropped the 12'' single \" Startin Shit\/ 3 Man Weave \" . Before long they were featured in The Source Magazine , representing music splurging from the city of Toronto. In 2000 Tilt Rock Records dropped Point Blank Underground - a compilation of 16 tracks from previous work, which sold roughly 5000 units.   The release was followed by the single \" Thin Line . \" The track grew to befall one of the most requested Canadian tracks in record pools all across Canada and charted on Flow 93.5's Battle of the Beats for a myriad of weeks. Success surrounded the group as they started getting features on main TV and Radio shows and appearing on publications such as Peace, Pound, Now Magazine as well as Toronto Star and The Sun . In 2003 Ed The Sock from Much Music visited Regent Park, giving the group a chance to speak in behalf of the neighborhood. Shortly after, Point Blank were invited to perform live on Much Music for Ed's big Wham Bam, as well as host Rapcity, where their video \" Want It Wit Us ,\" had reached the top 5 chart on MuchMusic's Rapcity.  \n\n5) An Oi! band from Beijing China.\nChen Hao (China) - Guitar\nJosh (USA) - Guitar\/Vocals\nWang Yun Hui (China) - Bass\nThomas (France) - Vocals\nNew Drummer soon \n\n6) Point Blank is an alias of techno producer Jeroen Verheij.

He is the leader and the main rapper in the South Korean boy group BTS, managed under Big Hit Labels.\n\nRM of BTS - Active during his pre-debut days as an underground rapper (Runch Randa). 13-year-old Nam-joon was already a prodigy in rap, he'd often attended gigs in his hometown Ilcheon and earned a place for himself in the underground scene at an early age, impressing even older underground rappers. He had made a collab with the famous rapper Zico back in 2008, the track can be found on many platforms including YouTube and SoundCloud.\n\nIn early 2015, RM earned not only the approval from big names in the Korean Hip-hop scene, but he had also gained respect from the American Hip-hop figure Warren G. The two came together for the track \"P.D.D\", where RM asks his haters to stay alive to witness his success. The west coast rapper stated in an interview with CJ America, \"I couldn\u2019t understand all his lyrics, but I can say that it was very good because his flow, style, and rhythm are all excellent.\u201d He then even went on to say, \"When I hear Rap Monster\u2019s songs, it sounds like Snoop Dogg or me rapping with the beats we\u2019ve made.\u201d \n\n On March 4, 2015, RM released a single with Warren G entitled, \"P.D.D (Please Don't Die)\" ahead of his first solo mixtape RM following an offer by Warren G to collaborate. The track reflected how RM felt towards those who hated and criticized him at the time, which he used to find very upsetting.\n\nThat same March, RM collaborated with hip hop project group MFBTY, EE and Dino J on the song \"Bucku Bucku\". He featured in the song's music video and also had a cameo appearance in a music video for another song by MFBTY, \"Bang Diggy Bang Bang\".\n\nHe released his first solo mixtape in the same year, titled 'RM'. It's a work where Namjoon discusses hip-hop's influence in his life, the hardships he'd experienced in pursuit of his career, as well as his struggle with self-love and self-acceptance. \"Awakening\", the third track of the mixtape, talked of his internal conflict between his two identities of \"rapper\" and \"idol\", as he had received backlash from the underground Hip-hop community prior to his debut with BTS, claiming that he'd betrayed his roots as a rapper. To this day, the mixtape is considered one of the best works inside the Korean Hip-Hop scene.\n\nFollowing RM's release, he featured along with Kwon Jin-ah on Primary's \"U\" that April. In August, RM collaborated with Marvel for Fantastic Four's soundtrack in Korea, releasing the digital single, \"Fantastic\" featuring Mandy Ventrice. \n\nIn August 2016, vocal duo Homme released a single titled \"Dilemma\", which was co-produced by RM and Bang Si-hyuk.\n\nIn 2017 was released the track \"Change\", a collab between Wale and Rap Monster (RM). The song talks of global violence, the school system, social injustice, and bullying. The two conversed through lyrics, claiming that people were controlled by the higher power and voiced out their wish of a changing world.\n\nIn 2018, he came out with a second mixtape named \"mono\". A project containing a few collaborations (with artists such as HONNE, NELL, eAeon) where Nam-joon experimented with lofi Hip-Hop and ballad. Though different from his previous works, he was still able to showcase his soul-deep lyricism, where he often implemented his skill of using wordplay and metaphors to further reach his listeners. With this mixtape, he continued to explore his own identity and life through a microscope, touching topics like loneliness, self-doubt, longing, and even explored the concept of love and hate. 'mono' proved RM a unique artist of diversity and growth. The mixtape is available on Spotify, iTunes, and SoundCloud. During its first day of release, the mixtape reached high positions on stream platforms, giving RM a profile with verification, resulting in his becoming of a more acknowledged rapper, producer, and songwriter.\n\nIn December, RM collaborated on a remix of Fall Out Boy's song \"Champion\". The track reached number 18 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and helped RM reach number 46 on the Emerging Artists Chart for the week of January 8, 2018.\n\nIn November, RM also collaborated with Tiger JK on his last and final album under the stage name Drunken Tiger, featuring on the track \"Timeless\". Tiger JK originally expected RM's lyrics to contain self-praise, which was the trend of rap at the time; RM instead wrote lyrics about leaving behind the historical meaning of Drunken Tiger's name.\n\nA lot of prestigious artists, from South Korea and EUA, found interest in RM and invited him for collaborations. Famous American rappers like Wale and Lil Nas X, even the rock group Fall Out Boy and famous Korean artists like Drunken Tiger and Gaeko.\n\nOn March 25, 2019, Honne announced that RM would feature on their remake of \"Crying Over You\" alongside singer BEKA, which was released on March 27.\n\nThe same day, Big Hit Entertainment released the song \"Persona\" as a trailer for BTS' EP Map of the Soul: Persona, performed as a solo by RM.\n\nIn 2019 Lil Nas X called RM for one of the remixes of his hit \"Old Town Road\". And this collab gave Namjoon and the other BTS members a chance to perform along with Lil Nas X for the first time on the 2019 edition of the Grammy's stage.\n\nOn December 29, it was announced that RM would feature on Younha's track \"Winter Flower\", released on January 6, 2020.\n\nRM also featured on \"Don't\", the lead single of Korean singer eAeon's second solo album released on April 30, 2021.\n\nBTS, on June 14 2022, announced that they will be taking a break from group activities to focus more on solo projects. RM subsequently appeared as a featured artist on the single \"Sexy Nukim\" by alt-pop group Balming Tiger in September,\n\nRM released his debut solo studio album, Indigo, led by the single \"Wild Flower\", on December 2. The album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, making him the highest-charting Korean soloist in chart history. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/RM\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

In two months Elymas (keyboards), who added wishful atmosphere, joined the band.\n\nThe debut Drama's album \"Silver Brilliance Of Nocticula\" was recorded shortly after demo tape Wintercrown\" in 2003. A short time later Elymas left the band because of a fatal accident. As a result of making a contract with Black Side Productions (Saint-Petersburg) \"Silver Brilliance Of Nocticula\" was released as MC (1000 copies) in December, 2003. Then Drama started working on the stuff for the next album.\n\nIn February, 2004 Drama came to Kazan for recording the second album Winds Choir Opera\".

Drama, born Terence L. Cook, a talented rapper from the state of Georgia in the US. His music is described as purely Southern-fried sound, with hyperkinetic beats, operatic electronica backing, and lyrical flows in which every breath seems destined to be his last.   Drama's impassioned, gruff growl lies somewhere between Ja Rule's and that of most of the No Limits posse. His song, \"Left, Right, Left\" was a club and radio hit.\n\n4. Drama, a progressive rock band from france.   In their beginnings they tried unsuccessfully to re-create the spirit of the 70\u2019s but without inspiration is not much what you can accomplish but they improved with the pass f the years..   The band was formed in the mid 90\u2019s in Rouen - France and in 1995 they release their first self titled album with Eric Azhar in the guitars, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Duboc playing bass, Laurent Guilhot the drummer, Richard Langlois in the keys and Jean-Marc Leclerc adds additional percussion, in track four.\n\nThere are a few things this guys should know, not everybody is able to play in the Genesis style and be successful, good instrumental debut but still it was evident something was missing and IMO it was ambition.  For their second release \u201cFlying through the 21st Century\u201d (1998), Jean-Marc Leclerc and Richard Langlois leave the band so Eric Azhar takes the keyboards and they recruit a vocalist named Louis de Fusco. In the first album the main problem is the lack of ambition, well they went to the other extreme, still keeping the main Genesis influence, they add ethnic influences from Africa, Asia and even the opener named \u201cLa Magna Carta\u201d with bagpipes, maybe they should stick to one sound and stop wandering, but still musically is a big evolution.  Now the problem is the high pitched vocalist de Fusco, they should have remained as an instrumental band, the guy really wasn\u2019t in the level for the band, the consequence was evident, the critics were devastating but they keep going.  In the year 2000 DRAMA was invited to Baja Prog where along with AFTER CRYING, ECLAT, ISILDURS BANE and PALLAS received the bet critics, surely their sound was already improving more.  In the year 2005, DRAMA surprises us with a their album called \u201cStigmata of Changes\u201d with a completely different lineup formed by Azhar (Who claims back the guitar) and Duboc from the original formation plus a new keyboardist Ralph Adam and of course a new vocalist named Yvon Lucas.  The change is for good, Lucas is far better than his predecessor, his voice is soft and gentle but serves perfectly for their new material and Adam\u2019s keyboards are pretty decent, heavily influenced by Genesis and Pink Floyd again with some bluesy and Folk influences.  This album is pretty good and makes us believe they can keep improving as they done through their career, hope this time we won\u2019t have to wait 7 years for a new release\n\n5. a Norwegian pop band from Larvik. They became a sensation when debuting on national television with the song \"Daydreamer (Breaking Away)\" as teenagers.\n\n6. Drama was a very short-lived progressive rock band from The Netherlands (1971-1973), which was a bit of a 'supergroup' of sorts. Band members such as Polle Eduard (ex-Tee Set) and Shell Schellekens (ex-The In Crowd and Big Wheel) had previously played in succesful groups. The band recorded just one studio album - and folded shortly after its release. The Dutch hit single, 'Mary's Mamma' (#20 in 1972), is very untypical for the band's musical style.\n\n7. The categorical beat-master McKaras from Lithuania\n\n8. Drama, better known as DJ Drama, is a famous hip-hop DJ. His most featured artist TI tips his cap the same way that DJ Drama does, except drama's cap it toward the back. He's a part of the clique, the Affiliates.\n\n9. Croatian Doom Sludge Metal\nDeadweight Loss was founded in 2004 as a trio featuring: Ognjen - drums, Stjepan - bass and Bruno - guitar. The initial idea was to play covers of Crowbar, Down and similar sludgecore bands but from the very begining there was a certain \"creative vibe\" surrounding the band so in just 2 months the band wrote 4 songs. After 8 months, Goran - guitar, joined the band and the band continued to evolve in new directions. After his arrival, the band continued working on their songs with more passion and creativity. Finally, after more than a year, Marko - vocals , joined the band and Deadweight Loss , at last , started to function as a whole unit . The first gig was played in club Mochvara 29.04.2005.\n\n12.04.2006. band recorded their first demo with 9 songs. After the recording process, Ognjen (drums) quit playing in Deadweight Loss. In the summer of 2006, after a long search, Matko joined the band and filled Ognjen's place perfectly. In the meantime, the band created 3 new songs which are conceptually quite different from the first few , so in that vein band changed their name from Deadweight Loss to - (drama). \n\n10.

In reggae, we were blessed with the maniacal genius of Lee Perry; in jazz, we had Sun Ra; and in hip-hop no one even comes close to the one they call Sensational (Born; Colin Julius Bobb on October 18, 1974.)\n\nHip-hop abounds with eccentric personalities such as Kool Keith, Old Dirty Bastard (R.I.P.), and Busta Rhymes, but Sensational trumps even these colorful MCs with an abstract flavor and a charm all his own. Born into the world of beats as Torture, a name perfectly befitting his dusted productions and not-ready-for-prime-time style, Sens linked up with the world-famous Jungle Brothers when he was only 15. Starting off as a back-up dancer , he went on to prove his mettle on the mic, rhyming to records by the German avant-garde electronic composer, Stockhausen. In fact, Torture's legendary performances on the Jungle Brothers' album JBeez Wit Da Remedy (Warner Bros., 1994), on which he rhymes at 180 beats per minute, are still way ahead of their time. (They may be heard on the Black Hoodz release, Crazy Wisdom Masters (BH006)).\n\nIn 1995, Torture came to the attention of WordSound through producer Bill Laswell, who had worked on the Jungle Brothers sessions. It was a match made in heaven as Torture changed his name to Sensational and released his solo debut, Loaded With Power (WSCD022), an album like no other in the annals of hip-hop. CMJ called it, \"The most bold and experimental hip-hop record of the last decade,\" but even this is an understatement. The tripped-out flows, broken beats, and lo-fi ambience all created an epic event in hip-hop that went largely unnoticed by the Puff Daddy-worshipping masses. And to think, it was all created by one man with a four-track, drum machine, and, of course, headphones used as a mic.\n\nUnlike most rap producers, Sensational has never been one to sample, but plays all his sounds live. Upgrading to an 8-track for his sophomore effort, Corner The Market (WSCD032), gave the rapper\/producer greater flexibility in recording. He also used a real microphone this time around instead of recording vocals through his headphones. Still wowing heads with his blunted, poetry-in-motion sickness, he released two singles for the popular indie rock label Matador (\"Party Jumpin\" and \"Beats, Rhymes & Styles\") before dropping his third full-length, Heavyweighter (WSCD037) which continues on a trajectory for outer space. As Timeout NY noted, Sensational is \"underground hip-hop's number one upstart-in-waiting.\" Sensational's unique style and personality have been showcased in the semi-biographical film Crooked (WSCD041), released by WordSound in 2001. The film, which documents the underground hip-hop scene in Brooklyn in the '90s, became an instant cult classic and is available on DVD along with its companion soundtrack, produced largely by Sensational.\n\nDuring the filming of Crooked, Sensational recorded Get on My Page for Mike Patton's Ipecac label, before returning to WordSound for his fifth release, Natural Shine (WSCD044), produced and recorded by DJ KLOS.

A songs craftsman, as he likes to consider himself.\n\nBorn Aug 22, 1961 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he began his professional musical career at the age of 17 playing keyboards in Ra\u00edces.\nIn 1981 he incorporated to one of the main bands of the Argentinean '80s rock scene: Los Abuelos de la Nada. Although the band was led by the brilliant Miguel Abuelo, Calamaro composed most of the band's hits, like \"Mil Horas,\" \"As\u00ed es el calor,\" \"Sin gamul\u00e1n\" and \"Costumbres Argentinas.\"\n\nIn 1984 he made his solo debut with Hotel Calamaro. The album was a bizarre mix of styles and musicians, and didn't gain public or press support.\n\nIn 1985 he left Los Abuelos de la Nada and registered his second album Vida Cruel. Inspite of the important musicians and guests, such as Luis Alberto Spinetta and Charly Garc\u00eda, the album was a disappointment: both commercially and artistically. But if as a songwriter the luck was out of reach, he had an intense and successful work as a producer of bands like Los Enanitos Verdes, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Don Cornelio y la zona. He also worked and collaborated with many artists of different styles and genres, a constant attitude through his whole career. The third album Por Mirarte showed Calamaro in a better shape with an established band. Released in 1988 it contains some outstanding songs such as \"Con los dientes apretados\" and \"Me olvid\u00e9 de los dem\u00e1s,\" while others like \"Cartas sin Marcar\" and \"Loco por t\u00ed\" helped the album to get popular.\n\nWhen Calamaro released in 1989 Nadie Sale Vivo de Aqu\u00ed, Argentina was living it's worst economical crisis: few albums were released. The album title suggest it all: Nobody comes out alive from here. The LP production was paralyzed, and the few that could make it were almost ignored. That was Calamaro's case. This situation lead the singer to settle in Spain, following a road taken by many Argentinean rockers. Out there in Spain he met Ariel Rot y Javier Infante, former members of Tequila. They formed Los Rodr\u00edguez in 1991, a pop-rock band that was very popular in Spain and Latin America: Calamaro's songs began to be popular like in the early '80s: the hit maker was on the road again. Curiously, from Spain, he was conquering Argentina. While being part of the band he didn't release any new solo material, just Grabaciones Encontradas 1 y 2, a couple of CDs that contained unreleased and rare material from the '80s. \n\nAfter the split of Los Rodr\u00edguez, Calamaro returned to his solo career recording Alta Suciedad in 1997, an album produced by Joe Blaney. This album brought him the commercial success that seemed to fail in his previous solo efforts, and sold 300.000 copies just in Argentina. That is certainly a huge amount for the country's small market. No doubts, that album helped him to be placed between the star legends of the national rock scene. Before that album Calamaro was considered an important character, appreciated by other musicians, but not a main one. After he broke up with his spanish girlfriend he released in 1999 the double CD Honestidad Brutal. Recorded when he was 37, it contained 37 songs of despair, love loss, drugs and regret. It was not as successful at the previous album, but showed a new Calamaro: desperate, decadent and often elegant at the same time, with a new and raw lyrical approach. El Salmon followed in spring 2001.\nCalamaro's next proyect, El Cantante, was released in 2005. A delicious mixture of tango, rock n'roll and flamenco guitars (mostly played by spanish prodigy El Ni\u00f1o Josele).\nAfter a break, he returned to the stages with a tour full of classics that gave birth to a live album called El Regreso on 2005, recorded with members of Bersuit Vergarabat as a backing band. This album was very well received for the charts as well as for the critics, wich lead him to different awards. One year later, on 2006, Andres published a new album from the roots of tango with the collaboration of guitarrists Ni\u00f1o Josele and Juanjo Dominguez. On 2007 El palacio de las flores was published, although it was recorded on 2006. The album had the collaboration and musical influence of argentine composer Lito Nebbia and was also recorded on his studio. This was the return to a classic Calamaro album with new songs and hits. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Andr%C3%A9s+Calamaro\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He is identified primarily with salsa romantica or \"salsa monga\", but has also experimented with styles ranging from Colombian vallenato to urban reggaeton. Unlike other young salsa performers such as Marc Anthony, he has neither recorded in English, nor made a Latin pop album, nor (with rare exceptions) ventured into acting, preferring to remain a musician grounded within salsa music.\n\nAlthough born in New York, V\u00edctor was raised primarily in A\u00f1asco and Isabela, Puerto Rico. Growing up in Puerto Rico had a great impact on his youth as he enjoyed salsa music (which was immensely popular in Puerto Rico at the time). His singing career began by chance, during a concert at his high school's graduation party by salsa superstar Gilberto Santa Rosa. At the instigation of classmates, who were going on about their friend the sonero, Santa Rosa invited V\u00edctor to jump up on stage and sing a song with him. To Santa Rosa's surprise, not only could Victor sing, but he \"free-styled\" the improvisational soneo lyrics in the song, and traded soneos with Santa Rosa. Shortly thereafter, on Santa Rosa's recommendation, Puerto Rican bandleader Don Peri\u00f1on hired teenage Victor as a backup singer. During these years of apprenticeship he performed with numerous salsa greats.\n\nThanks again to Santa Rosa, Manuelle was eventually signed as a solo artist to Sony Tropical.

The band primarily consists of former Engenheiros do Hawaii member Carlos Stein (guitar), Jo\u00e3o Vicenti (keyboards), Sady H\u00f6mrich (drums), Thedy Corr\u00eaa (lead vocals) and Veco Marques (guitar). One of the most famous Brazilian pop rock bands, they are well known for the song \"Camila, Camila\".\n\n\nAfter having helped form the band Engenheiros do Hawaii and playing in two shows, Carlos Stein left the band to form another band with some friends that he had known since elementary school, Sady Homrich and Thedy Correa. In 1986 in Rio Grande do Sul they started playing together and came up with the name Nenhum de N\u00f3s (None of Us). They wanted a name that would spark the curiosity of others, but also showed something that each of them had in common: None of us sees very well, None of us stayed in school, None of us joined the army, etc...\nThedy sang and played the acoustic guitar as a bass, Carlos played electric guitar and Sady played the drums. After only 6 shows the band caught the interests of a music producer from S\u00e3o Paulo and recorded their first album, Nenhum de N\u00f3s. The album was released in 1987 and contained their now classic Camila, Camila.\nTwo Years later, in 1989, they released their next album Cardume. Among the songs included on the album was \"O Astronauta de M\u00e1rmore\" (\"The Marble Astronaut\"), a Portuguese language version of David Bowie's \"Starman\". The band has since released 16 more albums and three DVDs.\nIn 1990, Veco Marques enters the band as rhythm guitarist (he also played as session musician in 'Cardume'). In 1991 the band played in Rock in Rio II. By 1994, Theddy stops playing the bass so he could have more stage presence, hiring touring musicians to play the bass in the concerts. In 1996 they were joined by their most recent member, Jo\u00e3o Vicente. Vicente played the piano, keyboard, and accordion, he died by kidney cancer in 2024, making the first time the band lost a member, for the moment, no one replaced Vicente function in the band, nether a session\/touring musician. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Nenhum+de+N%C3%B3s\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Show\" He began as a classical pianist, studying at the Havana Conservatory and under a Cuban government scholarship in Paris. At the age of 16, he moved to the U.S., first attending the Cambridge School of Music and then the Juilliard School of Music in New York. While at Juilliard, Melis learned to switch hats and perform as a lounge pianist and pop accompanist to pay the rent.\n\nJose Melis LPDrafted in 1943, he served as the musical director of the USO in New York City, playing at what was, in effect, one of the hottest clubs in the city. His Army duty threw him in with a wide variety of talents, including a young comic named Jack Paar.\n\nMelis became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1944 and remained in New York after the war. After a few years of working in nightclubs and on radio, Paar looked him up again and asked Melis to work as musical director for a show he was producing and starring in. Although the radio series was short-lived, Paar and Melis stayed in touch, and they collaborated on several other quickly-forgotten shows for CBS Television.\n\nFinally, Paar lucked out with a late-night talk and variety show called the \"Tonight! Show.\" The \"Tonight! Show\" became a hit. Paar put Melis' orchestra on the stage, rather than in the pit, and from the beginning, he included Melis in the on-camera patter that became one of the trademarks of the show. Melis' lively personality was popular with the show's audience, and became something of a star in own right, earning increasing airtime for his blend of pop and classical music (ala Liberace). Melis' \"I-M-4-U\" was used as the show's original theme song.\n\nHis \"Tonight! Show\" fame was translated into record contracts, first with the Latin-oriented Seeco label and later with Mercury. He left the show to concentrate on his own act, but although he toured with Mel Torme and even accompanied Frank Sinatra on several occasions, his star eventually faded in the early 1960s. He suffered a serious vision loss in the mid-1970s and lost his hearing in the 1980s. In 2003, he moved from the Bronxville, New York house he'd lived in since the \"Tonight! Show\" days to Sun City, where his son, Michael, looked after him until his death from a respiratory infection.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jose+Melis\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Although his parents ran a cafe, they were also great music enthusiasts, and Baselli began taking music lessons at the age of six. He and his brother Enrico both studied the accordion and, after a few years of serenading patrons in their parents' cafe, began playing on a semi-professional basis by their late teens.\n\nAfter World War Two, Baselli met an accomplished accordion player and pioneer of the bal musette style, Gus Viseur, who encouraged him to pursue a career in music. Baselli moved to Paris in 1950 and several years later, while working a summer job in Pau, near the Spanish border, met the rising young chanteuse, Patachou. She offered him the job of principal accompanist, and as her career took off, rivalling Edith Piaf's in popularity, he became a recognized soloist in his own right. Patachou opened a cafe in the Montmartre section of Paris, which became the center of the bal musette scene. Around the same time, Joss married Gus Viseur's daughter.\n\nIn 1958, Patachou toured the U.S. and Baselli attracted the attention of Sid Frey, owner of the Audio Fidelity record label. Frey was about to release the first series of long-playing stereo records and was signing numerous international artists. Renaming him Jo Basile, Frey first recorded Baselli straight, playing instrumental versions of Patachou's hits and other French cafe tunes.\n\nThen Baselli suggested he do some of the Italian songs he grew up playing in his parents' cafe, and the album, Rome with Love was released, with a cover featuring a sexy babe in Capri pants riding on the back of a Vespa. Whether the cover had anything to do with the success of the record, Frey figured it was a winning combination, and most of the two dozen albums Basselli recorded for Audio Fidelity over the next five years followed a standard formula. Basselli played a dozen or so tunes associated with a particular country or city, and Frey slapped on a cover featuring another sexy babe in national garb riding on the back of the same red Vespa--with an appropriate license plate.\n\nFor the quantity of material reflected in this series, the quality of performances is quite high. Baselli was a virtuoso accordion player, whose talents are now comemorated in France by an annual award that bears his name, given for the best accordion performance. For the most part, though, the material doesn't match the musicianship.\n\nA couple of the series, however, deserve a closer listen. Swingin' Latin is actually a set of early bossa nova tunes performed with the excellent Brazilian trio, Bossa Tres, and it's been reissued on CD recently as Jo Basile and Bossa Tres by Ubatuqui Records.\n\nMy favorite is Foreign Film Festival album, on which he swings through a set of tunes by Nino Rota and others with a crack group of New York session men that includes Bobby Rosengarden, Dick Hyman, Al Caiola, Milt Hinton, and Phil Kraus. It's a jazzy take on theme music from such early 1960s classics as \"La Dolce Vita,\" \"Rififi,\" and \"8\u00bd\" that shows Basselli could easily hold his own among players with such impeccable jazz chops and studio experience.\n\nIn all, Basselli's Audio Fidelity albums sold over 4 million copies in the U.S. He was awarded a prize by the American Accordion Association, and undoubtedly inspired many young men to take up the squeezebox--at least, until they discovered it tended not to attract sexy chick in Capri pants the way an electric guitar did.\n\nBack in France, Basselli parted ways with Patachou and joined the studio team of the singer Barbara, who launched an enormously successful variety series on French television. Basselli not only performed on screen as both accompanist and soloist, he also worked as musical director and arranged hundreds of songs for the show.\n\nHe stayed with the show until 1967, when he reunited with Patachou for another tour of the U.S. When he returned to France, he began to turn his attention to composing and arranging. He wrote the score for the movie, \"L'astragale,\" as well as for numerous television shows. One of the most notable of these was \"Le Man\u00e8ge Enchant\u00e9,\" a stop-action animated series by Serge Danot. A BBC producer asked actress Emma Thompson's father, Eric, to translate and record an English language narration, but Thompson decided the scripts just didn't work in English, and he wrote his own story, even renaming the characters. As \"The Magic Roundabout,\" the series was an even bigger success in the U.K. Basselli also composed the score for the full-length film Danot produced as a spin-off from the series, \"Dougal and the Blue Cat\".\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Baselli also worked as a songwriter, and his best-known tune, \"Free Again,\" was recorded by numerous Anglophone singers--most notably, Barbra Streisand, on the first track of her 1966 album, My Name is Barbra.\n\nIn 1972, Basselli hosted a series on French television titled, \"Le monde de l'accordeon,\" which featured masters of the instrument and encouraged young people to take up and learn the instrument. This time, no chick in Capri pants was promised. He also founded his own music publishing company, Opaline, to oversee the rights to his various compositions, and wrote a popular set of music instruction books on playing the accordion. He died suddenly of a heart attack in 1982.\n\n********Taken from www.spaceagepop.com******** <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jo+Basile\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Defever, former schoolmate Karin Oliver (vocals), and drummer Damian Lang released self-produced cassettes of their music, one of which made its way to Ivo Watts-Russell, founder of the pioneering art label 4AD. Intrigued with His Name Is Alive's blend of spectral vocals, poetic lyrics, and textural guitars, Watts signed the band.\n\nThe group recorded its first release for the label, Livonia, in Defever's home studio. The album features Oliver's shivery vocals along with tape loops, samples, and guitar blasts, for a noise-damaged, ethereal collection of songs about ghosts, reincarnation, and dreams. By 1992's Home Is in Your Head, the band's lineup and scope expanded. New singers Denise James, Karen Neal, Melissa Elliott, and guitarist Jymn Auge added depth and breadth to the band's original lineup. An epic 23 songs long, Home Is in Your Head ranges from folky ballads to electrifying guitar maelstroms and tape collages. That year also saw the release of The Dirt Eaters EP, named for Defever's other, more rock-oriented group, of which Elliot was also a member. In 1993, His Name Is Alive released two albums: King of Sweet, a limited-edition release that mixed tape effects, samples, demos, and unreleased songs, and Mouth by Mouth, which added more pop structure into the group's inherently experimental and dreamy sound, resulting in its most accessible and diverse album to that date. A new drummer, Trey Many, took over Lang's duties.\n\nAs Defever's reputation as an innovative producer spread, he lent his skills to bands like Grenadine, a side project of Tsunami's Jenny Toomey and Unrest's Mark Robinson, other 4AD acts like Liquorice (which featured Toomey, Dan Littleton from Ida, and His Name Is Alive's Many) and Tarnation, and other Detroit-area bands like Godzuki and Outrageous Cherry. Defever also worked on other projects, including the folky ESP Summer (with former Pale Saint Ian Masters) and the electronic Robot World and Control Panel, and founded the Time Stereo art collective with a childhood friend, artist\/musician Davin Brainard. Some of Time Stereo's projects included films, coloring books, and cassette-only releases from bands like Princess Dragon Mom, the Crash, Godzuki, New Grape, and Noise Camp.\n\nDefever's diverse interests influenced His Name Is Alive's next release, 1996's Stars on ESP. Very little of the group's original ethereal sound remained, augmented instead with touches of dub, folk, gospel, and early- to mid-'60s pop like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. At the time of the album's release, Defever claimed that he was so fascinated by the group's \"Good Vibrations\" that he listened to it for months at a time. The following year's Nice Day EP reached to garage rock and '60s R&B for its inspiration, and featured some of the gospel singers from Stars on ESP, including Lovetta Pippen, whose singing also gave His Name Is Alive's 1998 LP, Fort Lake, an earthy sensuality. Fort Lake also marked the first time the band worked with another producer, recording engineer Steve King. King, another Livonia native, had also worked with Funkadelic and Aretha Franklin, and his touch meshes nicely with the funk, soul, and classic rock allusions His Name Is Alive makes on the album. In preparation for recording Fort Lake -- named after a waterlogged Civil War fort in Michigan -- the group played monthly shows at the Gold Dollar, a tiny Detroit club. At this time, Pippen, bassist Chad Gilchrist, and additional drummer Scott Goldstein debuted as part of the new lineup.\n\nIn 1999, His Name Is Alive released a U.S. compilation of tracks from their first five albums called Always Stay Sweet; at the time, those albums were only available as British imports. Like the rest of the band's work, the compilation highlights their mercurial, unique nature. Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth appeared two years later. Released in 2002, the darkly soulful Last Night ended up being the group's final album for 4AD, but His Name Is Alive found other outlets for their music, and were actually busier than ever. Time Stereo released several CDs, such as 2004's ten-disc Cloud Box set, Leaf Club, Brown Rice, and The Detroit River, as well as many MP3-only works, including the Summer Bird and Something_Nothing EPs and a remastered version of King of Sweet. UFO Catcher was released in 2005 on CD by the German label En\/Of and on vinyl by Time Stereo, while Ypsilanti Records issued the full-length Summer Bird that spring. Late in 2005, His Name Is Alive released the Raindrops Rainbow EP via iTunes as a teaser for Detrola, their debut for Reincarnate, also the home of fellow former 4AD artist Lisa Germano and Sing-Sing, the project of former Lush member Emma Anderson. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/His+Name+Is+Alive\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He turned professional at age 18 when he joined Terrence Holder's band. He made his first recording with Lionel Hampton in 1942 where he played along with Red Allen, J.C. Higginbotham, Sid Catlett, Teddy Wilson and Hampton. Before that he performed with Fate Marable on New Orleans riverboats. Bostic graduated from Xavier University in New Orleans. He worked with territory bands as well as Arnett Cobb, Hot Lips Page, Rex Stewart, Don Byas, Charlie Christian, Thelonious Monk and other jazz luminaries. He formed his own band in 1945, and turned to rhythm and blues in the late 1940s. His biggest hits were \"Temptation,\" \"Sleep,\" \"Flamingo,\" \"You Go to My Head\" and \"Cherokee.\" At various times his band included Jaki Byard, John Coltrane, Benny Golson, Blue Mitchell, Stanley Turrentine, Tommy Turrentine, Keter Betts, Sir Charles Thompson, Teddy Edwards, Tony Scott, Benny Carter and other musicians who rose to prominence in jazz. Bostic held his musicians to a high standard and demanded that they read music faultlessly. He was influenced by the great Sidney Bechet. John Coltrane in turn was influenced by Earl Bostic. James Moody said that Bostic was the chief influence on John Coltrane. Moody mentioned that \"Bostic knew his instrument inside out, back to front and upside down.\"\n\nHis virtuosity is documented in records such as Up There In Orbit, Earl's Imagination, Apollo Theater Jump, All On, Artistry by Bostic, Telestar Drive, Liza, Lady Be Good and Tiger Rag. Bostic was a master of the blues and he used this skill in a variety of musical settings. Although Bostic recorded many commercial albums, some notable jazz based exceptions on the King label include Bostic Rocks Hits of the Swing Age, Jazz As I Feel It and A New Sound.\n\nBostic's King album titled Jazz As I Feel It featured Shelly Manne on drums, Joe Pass on guitar and Groove Holmes on organ. Bostic recorded the King Album \"A New Sound\" about one month later again, featuring Holmes and Pass. These recordings allowed Bostic to stretch out beyond the 3 minute limit imposed by the 45 RPM format. Bostic was pleased with the sessions which highlight his total mastery of the blues but they also foreshadowed musical advances that were later evident in the work of John Coltrane and Eric Dolphy.\n\nHe wrote arrangements for Paul Whiteman, Louis Prima, Lionel Hampton, Gene Krupa, Artie Shaw, Jack Teagarden and Alvino Rey.\n\nBostic's signature hit, \"Flamingo\" was recorded in 1951 and remains a favorite among followers of Carolina Beach Music in South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Their style of Beach Music is heavily influenced by Rhythm-and-Blues music from the 40's, 50's and 60's. Bostic recorded for Cincinnati-based King Records, a small label that was well known for releasing \"R and B\" and Bluegrass records. In fact, the biggest star on the King label was \"the Godfather of Soul\", James Brown. Bostic was also popular among R&B and jazz followers in the United Kingdom, thanks to his records that were released on the Parlophone label.\n\nBostic died from a heart attack in Rochester, New York, while performing with his band in 1965. His widow, Hildegarde, was still living in San Francisco as of the mid-1990s. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Earl+Bostic\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

In 1995, when Atli Heimir Sveinsson wrote the melody for the Marian prayer by Halld\u00f3r Laxness, the poem had recently been discovered. The future Nobel Prize laureate wrote it shortly after he had converted to Catholicism for a period of time in the twenties. The Ave Maria of Gunnar \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson and the Rev. Sigur\u00f0ur Helgi Gu\u00f0mundsson is the newest piece on the programme.

Born in London in 1932, her early recordings were mainly ballads, in the style of Anne Shelton. But by 1954, this was to all change. Her first major hit was \"Bell Bottom Blues\", and she scored her only number one in Britain with \"Dreamboat\" in 1956. Novelty songs were extremely popular at the time, and Alma recorded a number of these, including \"I Can't Tell A Waltz From A Tango\", \"Twenty Tiny Fingers\" and \"Never Do A Tango With An Eskimo\". She was known for the giggle in her voice when she sang and was affectinaltely known as The Girl With A Laugh In Her Voice. Her extravagant dresses were also a trademark. Her final UK hit was \"Cowboy Jimmy Joe\" in 1961, but was fast becoming an International Artist, with hits in Sweden, Germany, Israel and Japan - she had a number one hit in Japan with \"Just Couldn't Resist Her With Her Pocket Transistor\" which was at the top spot for over six months. As the novelty numbers were fast becoming old-fashioned by the start of the 1960s, she recorded a number of jazz standards and pop records, including five songs written by the Beatles - these recordings can be found on a number of CDs. Famed for her showbiz parties, with guests like Cary Grant, Noel Coward and the Beatles, she was never out of the public eye until ovarian cancer tragically cut her career short. She died on the 26th October 1966, aged just 34. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Alma+Cogan\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

In the mid 1960s she was singing with jazz musician Finn Ziegler, and it was suggested in 1966 that she enter a song in the Danish Eurovision selection, Dansk Melodi Grand Prix. She performed the song \"Stop - mens legen er go'\" (\"Stop, While the Going's Good\"), and to her surprise, emerged the clear winner. Ulla Pia stated in a recent interview that she had assumed that one of her better-known competitors (such as Dario Campeotto or Gustav Winckler) would win, and her victory came as a shock to her. Ulla Pia went forward to the eleventh Eurovision Song Contest, held on 5 March in Luxembourg City, where \"Stop - mens legen er go'\" could manage only 14th place of the 18 entries, despite an engaging performance in which Ulla Pia was joined on stage, unusually for the time, by two dancers. It would prove to be Denmark's last Eurovision appearance for over a decade, as broadcaster DR withdrew from the competition in 1967, and would not return until 1978.\n\nIn the years following her Eurovision appearance, Ulla Pia went on to release several popular singles in Denmark, notably \"Karina\" and the topical \"Flower Power T\u00f8j\". She toured regularly into the 1970s, but towards the end of the decade increasing family commitments, combined with a period of ill-health, caused her to retire from showbusiness. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ulla+Pia\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He is well known for a successful collaboration with fellow trombonist J. J. Johnson.\n\nWinding was born in Aarhus, Denmark. In 1934 his family emigrated to the United States. He graduated in 1940 from Stuyvesant High School in New York City, plus that same year he began his career as a professional trombonist with Shorty Allen's band. Subsequently, he played with Sonny Dunham and Alvino Rey until he entered the United States Coast Guard during World War II.\n\nAfter the war, Winding joined Benny Goodman's band, and later moved on to Stan Kenton's orchestra. Winding participated in the first of the Birth of the Cool sessions in 1949, appearing on 4 of the 12 tracks (while J. J. Johnson appears on the other eight, having participated on the other two sessions). In 1954, at the urging of producer Ozzie Cadena, he joined forces with Johnson to produce a highly successful series of trombone duet recordings, which were initially on Savoy Records and then on the Columbia Records label. While at Columbia, Winding experimented with different instrumentation in brass ensembles: the 1956 album Jay & Kai + 6 features a trombone octet, as well as Winding and Johnson performing on the trombone-like valved horn called the trombonium. Winding also arranged and\/or composed many of the tracks he and Johnson recorded. Unlike most players who absorbed the \"bebop\" style, Winding notably used more overtly trombonistic slide and mute effects from the earlier eras of jazz, as had another former Goodman trombonist Bill Harris, sounds which Johnson studiously avoided.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Winding had a long stint at Verve Records and under producer Creed Taylor made some of his most memorable jazz-pop albums. He released the first version of \"Time Is On My Side\" in 1963 before it was recorded by Irma Thomas and The Rolling Stones. His best selling recording from this period is \"More,\" the theme from the movie Mondo Cane. Arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman, \"More\" featured what is probably the first appearance of the French electronic music instrument the Ondioline on an American recording. Though Winding himself was credited with playing the Ondioline, guitarist Vinnie Bell, who worked on the session, has said he remembers distinctly that the French electronic-music pioneer Jean-Jacques Perrey was the actual player. He served as Musical Director for the Playboy Club, in mid-sixties New York, when rock was beginning to edge out jazz as the fashionable club music.\n\nWhile at Verve, Winding further experimented with various ensembles, made solo albums, and even an album of country music with the Anita Kerr Singers. In the late 1960s, Winding followed Creed Taylor to his new recording label at A&M\/CTI and made at least two more albums with Johnson.\n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, Winding recorded for a number of independent record labels. During this time, he continued to give clinics, play jazz concerts and even reunited with Johnson for a live concert in Japan. He was a member of the all-star jazz group Giants of Jazz in 1971-2. He also wrote instructional jazz trombone books that included transcribed solos.\n\nWinding died of a brain tumor in New York City in 1983. He was survived at the time by his wife, the accomplished painter Ezshwan Winding, and his son, the session keyboardist Jai Winding.\n\nDiscography\n\nAs leader\/co-leader\nKai Winding All Stars (Roost, 1949-51 [1952])\nTrombone by Three (Prestige, 1949 [1956]) with J.

Their youthful, clean-cut image, distinct styling featuring tartan-trimmed outfits, and cheery, sing-along pop hits helped the group become among the most popular musical acts of their time. For a relatively brief but fervent period (nicknamed \"Rollermania\"), they were a worldwide sensation.\n\nBassist Alan Longmuir, his younger brother Derek Longmuir, a drummer, along with school mate, lead singer Gordon \"Nobby\" Clark founded the group in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1967, as The Saxons. Shortly afterwards, seeking a less English-sounding moniker, they chose a new name allegedly by throwing a dart at a map of the United States. The dart landed on the map in the state of Arkansas, but since \"Arkansas Rollers\" did not sound quite right, and might also lead to problems with pronunciation, they tried again and this time the dart landed near the community of Bay City, Michigan.\n\nThe Bay City Rollers were managed from early on by the imposing and controversial Tam Paton, himself a former big band leader. Paton was notorious for his rigid control over all aspects of the band's career, including the shuffling in and out of group members at a very high rate. Short term members from this period include David Paton (member 1969-1970) and Billy Lyall (member 1969-1971), who went on to be founding members of another successful Edinburgh band, Pilot.\n\nThe Bay City Rollers received their first break when prominent record executive Dick Leahy caught their act by chance in an Edinburgh club. After signing with Leahy's Bell Records, the band's first hit was \"Keep on Dancing\" (UK #9, 1971), a cover of a 1965 Gentrys hit, recorded at the suggestion of pop impresario and producer Jonathan King. (Singer Nobby Clark was backed on vocals on \"Keep on Dancing\" by King himself.) Upon this release's success, they made guest appearances on BBC-TV's Top of the Pops. The group then won a Radio Luxembourg-sponsored song contest with the tune \"Ma\u00f1ana\", which was later popular in parts of Europe and in Israel.\n\nSeveral non-charting singles were released over the following two years. This period did see the addition of long term members Eric Faulkner and Stuart \"Woody\" Wood.\n\nIn late 1973 they narrowly missed the UK chart with \"Saturday Night\", one of many singles written and produced for the band by the highly successful songwriting duo of Scotsman Bill Martin and Irishman Phil Coulter.\n\nBy the end of 1973, Nobby Clark had become disillusioned by the band's lack of success and decided to move on. He was replaced as lead singer by Leslie McKeown.\n\nThe five members at the very end of 1973 - the Longmuir brothers, Faulkner, Wood and McKeown - are generally referred to as the \"classic line-up\". In early 1974 McKeown hastily re-recorded lead vocals of the group's forthcoming single, \"Remember (Sha La La La)\", which became a sizable hit and a lead in to a series of UK chart hits.\n\nBeginning with \"Remember\" (UK #6), the Rollers' popularity exploded, and they released a string of very successful hits on the British charts. Following in succession were \"Shang-a-Lang\" (UK #2), \"Summerlove Sensation\" (UK #3), and \"All of Me Loves All of You\" (UK #4).\n\nBy early 1975, they were one of the highest-selling acts in Britain. That year saw a successful UK tour (which prompted newspaper headlines about \"Rollermania\"), and a 20-week UK television series, Shang-a-Lang.\n\nA cover of the Four Seasons' \"Bye, Bye, Baby\", stayed at #1 in the UK for six weeks in the spring of 1975, selling nearly a million copies to become the biggest seller of the year, and the subsequent single \"Give a Little Love\" topped the charts that summer, their second #1 hit. At the peak of their popularity in the UK, comparisons were even made to The Beatles.\n\nBy this time, BCR fans had a completely distinctive style of dress, the main elements of which were ankle length tartan trousers and tartan scarves which they had copied from another Tam Paton Band \"Bilbo Baggins\".\n\nAs the group's popularity swelled to superstardom in the UK, a concerted effort was made by Arista Records (the record company that evolved from Bell) to launch the Rollers in America. New Arista head Clive Davis was instrumental in grooming and overseeing the project. His work paid off as in early '76, the Rollers reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 with \"Saturday Night\", the song which had missed the UK chart completely two years earlier. A second US hit came with \"Money Honey\" which hit #9, and finally reaching a lackluster 62 with a cover version of Dusty's love power. Prior to that, they made their American TV debut on Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell singing Saturday Night.\n\nThe dark side of the band's unending schedule of tours and appearances was the great amount of stress the band members felt. By early '76, the strain of success (and the discomfort of a mature man in a teen band) had taken its toll on bassist Alan Longmuir, who decided to leave the group. He was replaced for 7 months by 17 year old Ian Mitchell - the first band member born outside of Edinburgh, Scotland (he was from Northern Ireland). With Mitchell, the group released an album titled Dedication, and hit the charts with a cover version of the Dusty Springfield song \"I Only Want To Be With You\", which reached US #12, as well as \"Yesterday's Hero\" and \"Dedication\".\n\nAs the Rollers' popularity waned, the shuffling of personnel continued: Mitchell quit the band, replaced by Pat McGlynn. The group's commercial success began to decline towards the end of the 1970s. In 1977, they covered an unsuccessful 1973 single by String Driven Thing, \"It's a Game\" to give them their final UK Top 20 hit (#16 in the spring), but \"You Made Me Believe in Magic\" could only make #34 in the summer. It managed to just crack the top ten in the United States, but this would be their final major success there too. Summer of 1977 saw the group release the It's a Game album and world tour as a four-piece group - McKeown, Wood, Faulkner and Derek Longmuir.\n\nIn 1978, Alan Longmuir reunited with the band for the recording of Strangers in the Wind. The release of this LP was timed to coincide with the debut of the Rollers' US television show \"The Krofft Superstar Hour\" later renamed \"The Bay City Rollers Show\" on the NBC network. The show was a poor match for the band. Their time in the teen-idol spotlight was slipping away and their music had matured and become more sophisticated compared to the bubblegum hits they had released in '75-'76. The show and album were each dismal failures.\n\nLes McKeown left to pursue a solo career after an on-stage fight with Faulkner in Japan.The Rollers fired Tam Paton in 1979. South African-born Duncan Faure was hired to replace McKeown as lead vocalist and the band shortened its name to The Rollers. Three albums were issued under this name, including Voxx (1980) and 1981's Ricochet, before the group disbanded.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, there were various short-lived revivals featuring some of the original members, including a New Year's Eve 1999 concert. Interest was rekindled in Britain by television documentaries about the group and a television-advertised compilation of greatest hits, which entered the UK charts on release in 2004 at its #11 peak.\n\nCurrently, there is one touring version using the group's name: Les McKeown's Legendary Bay City Rollers.\n\nAlan Longmuir died on 2 July 2018 in an Edinburgh hospital after contracting an illness while on holiday in Mexico. He was 70. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bay+City+Rollers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

As a child, she would fall asleep to her father's soothing voice. His serenades planted inside her a love for music, which grew stronger every day against her family's wishes. In 1954, at the age of 9, she entered a small contest in the city of Hanoi singing Tho Ngay; she did not win.\n\nBy 1956, she accompanied her mother to the southern regions of Vietnam. At the end of that very same year, she secretly entered a children's talent-search contest produced by Phap-A production at Norodom Stage in Saigon. Mai traveled to the contest by sneaking into the back of transport trucks and hitching a ride from Da Lat City to Saigon. She won second prize singing Pham Duy's famous song, Ngay Tro Ve. Mai lost to child-star Quoc Thang who would also later become an iconic figure in the music world. She was only 11.\n\nMai's musical career did not officially begin until she debuted at Club Anh Vu on Bui Vien Street in Saigon when she was only 17 (1962). At this point, she adopted the stage name Khanh Ly, a combination of Khanh Ky and Yeu Ly, both are characters from Three Countries, her favorite novel. By the end of 1962, she relocated to Da Lat and stayed there for four years performing at various clubs and resorts. Night after night, she serenaded lovers, tourists, and the youths of Vietnam. On a rainy night in 1964, she met Trinh Cong Son (TCS), at that time a young composer, at a club in Da Lat. They became fast friends. Fascinated by her seductive voice, Trinh had asked her on several occasions to accompany him in his performances in Saigon. Still in love with the romantic hills of Da Lat, she declined.\n\nDuring a trip to Saigon in 1967, she ran into Trinh on the busy streets of Le Thanh Ton. After several serenades and coffee at a small shop called Quan Van, the legacy of Khanh Ly and Trinh Cong Son has begun. Within the next several decades, Khanh Ly and Trinh Cong Son sang together at small coffee shops, clubs, and even on the steps of Van Khoa University in Saigon (a liberal arts school). During the North American Invasion of Viet Nam, the imperialist aggression that followed after the Vietnamese people had regained their freedom by expelling the french colonialists, his anti-war lyrics in the Yellow-Skin Songs and her luring voice appealed to those who grew weary of the battles and bloodshed; their plea for peace propelled them to the top. From the educating fields of large universities to the unknown and endless farm lands, she was heard, known, and hailed as \"Nu Hoang Chan Dat1,\" or \"Nu Hoang San Co.\" Together, Khanh Ly and Trinh Cong Son took the Vietnamese music world by storm. Their phenomenal fame gave her the chance to be the first Vietnamese woman to headline her own show. During the late 60s to early 70s, she also collaborated with multiple production companies and played a large part on the recorded tracks from famous videos such as the Pham Manh Cuong Program, Truong Son Centre, Son Ca Productions, Hoa Mi, Jo Marcel Productions, etc\n\nUp until her emigration in 1975, Khanh Ly achieved unproportional fame around the world. She opened Club Khanh Ly on Tu Do Street in Saigon along with a small shop named Hoi Quan Cay Tre, a gathering place for musicians and students alike. In addition, she was sponsored by the Vietnamese government to hold performances in Europe in order to promote the worldwide collaboration of the rising generation of Vietnamese students (\"Noi Vong Tay Lon\"). She also performed in the United States, Canada, and Japan at Osaka Fair in response to the invitation from Nippon Columbia Label (a large production company). Here, she recorded an album, featuring TCS's songs Diem Xua and Ca Dao Me (sang in both languages), which went gold shortly after its debut. These songs became top hits in Japan and remained so for several decades. Khanh Ly was the first Vietnamese singer to achieve international fame.\n\nIn 1975, Khanh Ly moved to the U.S.A. the country that had massacred her country of origin only years prior. Like many, she struggled to find jobs on American soil to provide for her four children. Even though the first few years were difficult, Khanh Ly's renowned status did not fade from the music world. Within the late 70s and throughout the 80s, Khanh Ly was invited back to Japan on numerous occasions by Nippon Columbia Label, Toci Film, and Japans largest television station to record and perform. Her second record with Nippon Columbia (1979) went gold short after its release; there were 2 million copies sold in Japan alone. Her third and final album with Nippon also featured classic hits such as Wondering Man. In addition, both Toci Film and Japans largest television station featured her voice in the theme song to several movies and television series regarding Vietnam's culture as well as the \"Boat People\" phenomenon; her most notable recording was \"Loi Ru Cho Da Nang\" in 1987, music by Japanese artist Hako and words by former newspaper editor and Khanh Ly's husband, Nguyen Hoang Doan. In 1996, Japans television station NKH and famous producer Hideo Kado produced a short 50-minute documentary about the life of Khanh Ly which aired on April 29, 1997, 22 years from the day she left Saigon. In September of that year, NKH also published a 270-page biography about Khanh Ly.\n\nIn the later part of the 80s and early 90s, Khanh Ly traveled vigorously and performed in Russia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and in a concert in Germany after the Berlin Wall was taken down in 1989. Being of the Catholic faith, she also sang at many church-sponsored events in which her most memorable performance was at the Canonization of 117 Vietnamese Priests in Vatican City (1988) where she met Pope John Paul II. In 1992, during the World's Youth Festival in U.S.A. Khanh Ly met the Pope a second time. In 1996, she, several other renowned singers, and song writer Tram Tu Thieng hosted a Charity Concert. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kh%C3%A1nh+Ly\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

His relaxed style of singing was a major influence on later stars Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson.\n\nFrizzell was born in Corsicana, Texas, but moved with his family shortly after his birth to El Dorado, Arkansas, where they remained until the early 1940s. Frizzell began playing the guitar as a very young boy and by age 12, he was appearing regularly on a children's show at a local radio station KELD.\nThe family moved back to Texas when Frizzell was still a teenager, and his music career got a boost when he won a talent contest in Dallas.\n\nIn his late teens, he was performing at fairgrounds and other venues, developing a unique, soulful voice. Like his father, he got work in the oilfields, but his growing popularity as a singer soon gave him regular work on the Honky Tonk nightclub circuit. At age 19, he had a half-hour show on a small Texas radio station, getting a big break when a record producer heard him sing. Signed to Columbia Records, he immediately had a string of hits that broke into country music's top ten; several of them reached # 1.

A prolific songwriter, Frizzell had four songs in the country top ten at the same time in 1951 \u2014 a feat that would not be repeated on any chart until The Beatles accomplished it on the pop charts, with five songs in 1964.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, rock and roll was dominating the North American music scene, but although no one would ever mistake Frizzell's music for anything but country, his 1959 hit, \" Long Black Veil,\" gained wide acceptance with a variety of music fans in addition to country, and was the first recording of this \"standard.\" A few years later, Frizzell recorded \" Saginaw, Michigan,\" which took the #1 spot on the country music charts and broke into the pop charts as well. The song earned him a Grammy Award nomination.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Frizzell changed record labels and moved to Bakersfield, California, where he recorded several more country music hits and became the first country singer to perform at the Hollywood Bowl. By then, however, his problems with alcoholism were already taking their toll. Mood swings and outbreaks of irrational anger became a trademark, and his constant failure to meet recording commitments strained his relationship with his recording company. In 1972, Lefty Frizzell was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and his song \"If You've Got the Money, I've Got the Time\" earned him a Grammy Hall of Fame Award. Unfortunately, success and money only added to Frizzell's alcohol addiction, and on July 19, 1975, he suffered a massive stroke and died at age 47. He was buried on \"Music Row\" at Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens in Goodlettsville, Tennessee.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lefty+Frizzell\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Her parents were Pham Dinh Sy and stage and film actress Kieu Hanh who was mostly known for having acted in such plays as Loi Vu and Trong Bong Hau Truong and in feature films like Chung Toi Muon Song (We Want to Live) (1956) starring Le Quynh and Mai Tram and Song Tinh (1972) starring Tham Thuy Hang.  Her father was the eldest brother of Pham Dinh Viem who was also known as singer Hoai Trung of the Northern Vietnamese singing group, Thang Long.  He also had three younger half-siblings, Pham Thi Quang Thai, a singer known as Thai Hang and wife of legendary composer Pham Duy, Pham Dinh Chuong, a songwriter and singer known as Hoai Bac and Pham Thi Bang Thanh, Vietnam's most celebrated legendary female singer of popular music known as Thai Thanh.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s until 1975, Mai Huong enjoyed one of the longest tenures as a professional singer for Radio Vietnam.  She worked alongside such renowned Vietnamese vocalists like Thai Thanh, Quynh Giao, Chau Ha, Mai Han, Mai Ngan, Anh Ngoc, Thanh Vu, Moc Lan, Duy Trac, Ha Thanh and Hoang Oanh.  Mai Huong introduced songs written and composed by some of Vietnam's most prolific songwriters such as Pham Duy, Van Cao, Van Phung, Y Van and Ngoc Bich and became one of the most recognizable voices throughout Vietnam.  Among the most popular songs interpreted by Mai Huong include Suoi Toc written by Van Phung, Gui Gio Cho May Ngan Bay written by Doan Chuan and Tu Linh, Ta Tu written by To Vu, Dua Em Tim Dong Hoa Vang written by Pham Duy and Chieu Mo written by Ngoc Bich.  In addition, she also hosted a program for Radio Vietnam as narrator of short stories and novels. \n\nMai Huong had gained national stardom through Radio Vietnam, but unlike most other singers in Vietnam of her day she rarely made any live performances.  For more than a decade since turning professional, she shied away from performing at nightclubs and cabarets.  Finally, in 1970 after having repeatedly turned down offers from various nightclub owners and promoters, Mai Huong agreed to a 6-month contract to perform nightly at the prestigious Tu Do cabaret venue in Saigon which was then run by singer Khanh Ly.  However, on the very last night of her 6-month engagement at Tu Do, tragedy struck when a bomb exploded inside the nightclub unexpectedly which left at least 20 victims injured and took the life of actress Thuy Ngoc, wife of musician Le Van Hien.  Although Mai Huong did not suffer any serious physical injuries, the traumatic experience devastated her so that she swore off to performing at cabarets altogether.\n\nOn April 22, 1975, just 8 days before the Fall of Saigon, Mai Huong and her family left their native Vietnam for the United States.  After a week spent in Guam, they would resettle in Southern California making it their permanent new home.  Beginning a new life in the United States faraway from her homeland, Mai Huong had already prepared herself mentally for the likelihood that she would not be able to continue with her music career.  Since the Vietnamese community in the United States during the 1970s was still at its early stages of development, she was well aware of the limitations set out against her should she choose to continue pursuing her career in music.  Mai Huong then embarked on an entirely different new profession and became a full time employee at Bank of America.  Just as she was settling into a quiet life with a daily nine to five routine, the small but growing overseas Vietnamese entertainment industry then came calling for her once again.  Her first one-night engagement performing for an overseas Vietnamese audience was in 1976 in New Orleans, Louisiana.  The well received performance then led to numerous other gigs as the overseas Vietnamese population gradually increased with new arrivals of refugees on an almost weekly basis during the final years of the 1970s.  For more than two decades, Mai Huong sucessfully juggled a full time job at Bank of America on weekdays, traveling off to faraway places performing at live shows for Vietnamese communities across the United States and Canada on weekends while maintaining a family life.  In 1977, Mai Huong toured France as the featured special guest along with a gala of other overseas Vietnamese performance artists in a live show revue directed by musician\/show promoter Hoang Thi Tho.  Ten years later, she would be invited back on another successful European tour where she played to overseas Vietnamese audiences in France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Holland.   Mai Huong had also performed in concert for the Vietnamese community of Australia.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Mai Huong along with fellow singers Kim Tuoc and Quynh Giao formed the trio, Tieng To Dong, which specialized in performing the genre of Vietnamese classical music known as Nhac Tien Chien.  She recorded a total of 10 solo studio albums for various overseas Vietnamese music production labels such as Truong Hai, Diem Xua Productions, Mai Ngoc Khanh, Giang Ngoc and Tu Quynh.  In 1982, Bong Ngay Qua, her first solo studio album for the overseas Vietnamese market was released under the label, Tu Quynh.  Among her most well received solo studio albums include Giac Mo Hoi Huong (1983), Nhat Canh Sao Roi (1990), Di Choi Chua Huong (1993), Tinh Ca Duong Thieu Tuoc (1992), Vang Phai May La (1997), Lo Chuyen Do (2000) and Nhu Ngon Gio Buon Roi (2002).  In addition to her interpretations of Vietnamese classical music, Mai Huong is also a highly respected gospel singer.   \n\nBorn in Da Nang in 1941, Pham Thi Mai Huong spent her childhood years moving from various different cities throughout Vietnam including Hue, Hanoi and finally, Saigon, which would become her permanent home from the age of 11 up until 1975 when she left her homeland just days prior to the Fall of Saigon.  Before making her stage debut as a singer, Mai Huong as a child had made her first appearance on stage as an actress with a small part in the play. Tam Guong Nhi Nu, starring her aunts and uncles, Thai Thanh, Hoai Trung, Hoai Bac and Khanh Ngoc.  At the age of 12, she successfully competed in the vocals talent search hosted by Ph\u00e1p \u00c1 French-Vietnamese Radio Broadcasting held at the Norodom Venue.  The following year Mai Huong performed her first solo, Han Ly Huong written by Anh Hoa, on stage in front of a live audience.  \n\nDuring her senior year at Nguyen Ba Tong High School in Saigon, Mai Huong had also enrolled at Quoc Gia Am Nhac, which was then known as National Conservatory of Music and has since been renamed as Conservatory of Ho Chi Minh City.  During her 3 years at National Conservatory of Music, she learned to play the violin and the dan tranh, a Vietnamese plucked zither instrument similar to the Japanese koto,  She also studied French and took many courses to hone her skills in chorale music vocals while at the conservatory. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mai+H%C6%B0%C6%A1ng\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

His music has been performed in countless countries and in the most prestigious concert halls, and all of this was possible thanks to his unique flair of melody. The fertile creative imagination of Maestro Raimonds Pauls has brought together the intonations of Latvian folk music, jazz, blues, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, French chanson, German schlager and the intonations and elements of national popular songs with the arising trends and always manages to create contemporary and generally attractive music that is at the same time thoroughly democratic.\n\nIt is characterized by modern rhythms and arrangements, but a fine feeling of harmony allows the composer to avoid the monotony that plagues many modern pieces of pop music. Unlike many other songwriters, Raimonds Pauls himself is often the interpreter of his own compositions or the concert master of performers. A hallmark of his sound is a very individual, short and accentuately curted stroke that is a distinct characteristic of his style. But he is not afraid to entrust his melodies for the interpretation of other creative groups or to form special bands of performers and produce the sound of his music by himself. \n\nAfter the brilliant career as a jazz pianist and composer in the 60s, Raimonds Pauls has chosen the medium of song as his major form of expression and at the same time has managed to act out his fantasies as a composer in large staged spectacles - musicals and musical comedies. He always picks the most talented singers and musicians to perform his work and this way he increases the quality of his art to heights unreachable by others. In addition, the bright intuition of Raimonds Pauls continues to surprise with new and unexpected projects, and his creations have been an integral part of Latvian popular music for 50 years, some of them even enjoy the status of folklore. Songs of Raimonds Pauls are popular among listeners of any age not only in Latvia, because many residents of the former Soviet Union took the love towards the excellent music of Raimonds Pauls with them, when they emigrated and Maestro still receives invitations to perform in many countries all over the world. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Raimonds+Pauls\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Of course, this only made fans wet for more, so the Nobodys came again with their 1997 tour de force, \"Smell of Victory\" (produced by Warren Fitzgerald of The Vandals).\n\nTours with The Queers, Chixdiggit and Guttermouth won over even more converts.

Aziz is still one of the most popular qawwals of South Asia. He is responsible for the longest commercially released qawwali, Hashr Ke Roz Yeh Poochhunga, which runs slightly over 115 minutes.\n\nAziz Mian was born as Abdul Aziz (Urdu: \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u06cc\u0632) in Delhi, British India. The exclamation Mian, which he often used in his qawwalis, became part of his stage name. He began to introduce himself as Aziz Mian Mairthi. The word Mairthi refers to Meerut, a city in northern India, from which he migrated to Pakistan in 1947.\n\nAt the age of ten, he began learning the art of Qawwali under the tutelage of Ustad Abdul Waheed Khan. He received sixteen years of training at the Data Ganj Baksh School of Lahore, and obtained a degree in Urdu literature from the University of Punjab, Lahore.\n\nAziz Mian was one of the more traditional Pakistani Qawwals. His voice was raspy and powerful. Aziz Mian was the only prominent qawwal[citation needed] to write his own lyrics (though, like others, he also performed songs written by other poets).\n\nHis break-out performance was in 1966, when he performed before the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. He won first prize and a gold medal from the Shah of Iran.

He was known for a \"more recitative, more dramatic diction\" and inclined toward qawwali's religious rather than entertainment qualities, though he also enjoyed success in more romantic qawwals.\n\nFor his service in philosophy and music, the Government of Pakistan awarded him the Pride of Performance medal in 1989.\n\nHe was fond of discussing religious and Sufi paradoxes in his qawwalis. He directly addressed Allah and complained about the misery of man (the greatest creation of the Almighty). In addition to his own poetry, Aziz Mian performed poetry by Allama Iqbal, and a number of contemporary Urdu poets, including Sadiq and Qateel Shifai.\n\nAziz Mian died from complications of hepatitis in Tehran, Iran on December 6, 2000. He was in Iran at the invitation of the Government of Iran, to perform on the occasion of Imam Ali's death anniversary.

Born on July 25, 1937 in Hu\u1ebf, Central Vietnam, she grew up as the fourth eldest in a family of ten children. H\u00e0 Thanh began her professional singing career at the age of 16 after winning first prize at a talent contest sponsored by Radio Vietnam in Hue. Her performance of D\u00f2ng S\u00f4ng Xanh (The Blue Danube) swept the judges off their feet earning her the highest marks among contestants. Immediately following her victory, H\u00e0 Thanh became a professional singer for the Radio Vietnam station in Hu\u1ebf, Central Vietnam.\n\nFor ten years, H\u00e0 Thanh remained content working as a vocalist for Radio Vietnam in Hu\u1ebf.  Her popularity with listeners had grown steadily through the years making her the most popular singer in Central Vietnam. As H\u00e0 Thanh's singing voice would gain new audiences through Radio Vietnam's broadcasts in other regions, Saigon, the center of Vietnam's music industry, eventually came calling. In 1963, H\u00e0 Thanh made her first trip to Saigon to record a couple of songs at the invitation of S\u00f3ng Nh\u1ea1c record label. It was during this trip that she would be introduced to musician Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n \u0110\u00f4ng through a mutual acquaintance, singer\/songwriter M\u1ea1nh Ph\u00e1t. Prior to returning to her hometown of Hu\u1ebf, H\u00e0 Thanh would make a memorable live performance of V\u1ec1 M\u00e1i Nh\u00e0 X\u01b0a (Coming Back Home) with Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n \u0110\u00f4ng's band known as Ti\u1ebfng Th\u1eddi Gian for a music festival concert held in Saigon. Two years later, she would relocate to Saigon, this time at the invitation of another prominent record label by the name of Continental which was headed by Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n \u0110\u00f4ng.\n\nMuch like the legendary collaborations between singers and composers like Thanh Th\u00fay with Tr\u00fac Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng, Th\u00e1i Thanh with Ph\u1ea1m Duy and Kh\u00e1nh Ly with Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n, H\u00e0 Thanh found enormous success through her recordings of songs written by Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n \u0110\u00f4ng such as H\u00e0ng H\u00e0ng L\u1edbp L\u1edbp, Chi\u1ec1u M\u01b0a Bi\u00ean Gi\u1edbi, Nh\u1edb M\u1ed9t Chi\u1ec1u Xu\u00e2n and M\u1ea5y D\u1eb7m S\u01a1n Kh\u00ea. From 1965 until 1975, H\u00e0 Thanh was one of the most popular female singers of Vietnam. As one of the busiest recording artists in extremely high demand, her collaborations for numerous record labels in Vietnam such as Premier, S\u01a1m Ca, Vi\u1ec7t Nam, Shotguns and Tr\u01b0\u1eddng S\u01a1n allowed her to command the highest salary among singers in the music industry of Vietnam in her day. Once resettled in Saigon, H\u00e0 Thanh continued her work with Radio Vietnam as one of the most renowned musical performers in radio broadcasting. She became a headliner performer at the prestigious Tu Do cabaret in Saigon and also performed for many music festivals and concerts for ARVN troops and universities. In 1969, H\u00e0 Thanh was selected by the government of South Vietnam to perform on a concert tour for Vietnamese foreign exchange college students studying abroad in France.\nPrior to resettling in the United States, H\u00e0 Thanh like many other popular singers from the pre-'75 Saigon era had been restricted by the communist regime from continuing with her music career in Vietnam. Unable to earn a living as a professional singer for almost a decade after the Fall of Saigon had made life difficult for H\u00e0 Thanh and her daughter. At the time of her arrival to the United States, H\u00e0 Thanh was already approaching middle age. In a field such as the entertainment industry where age can certainly play a significant role in one's potential for success, H\u00e0 Thanh's return to the music business after resettling in the United States was not without its challenges.  However, due to her past career achievements and rather large following of fans she had acquired from way back in Saigon prior to 1975, H\u00e0 Thanh's legendary iconic status would sustain the interests of several prominent music producers and events promoters within the overseas Vietnamese music industry in the 1980s. Among those producers was L\u00ea Ba Ch\u01b0, the owner of Gi\u00e1ng Ng\u1ecdc music production label, who had also been a fan of H\u00e0 Thanh.

In addition, Rose was musical director for the Red Skelton show during its 21-year-run on the CBS and NBC networks. He was a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music.\n\nRecipient of four Emmy awards, David Rose was born in London to Jewish parents and raised in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nHe was married on October 8, 1938, to the actress Martha Raye.

It evinces a jazz influence with especially prominent trombone lines, and evokes the feel of music used to accompany striptease artists. The piece features in the films Slap Shot, The Full Monty and Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit as well as TV series Little Britain and Scrubs. It was also famously used in a parody by British comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, where they danced to the tune while making breakfast. It also is often used in cartoons and sitcoms when an attractive female enters a room.\n\n\"Holiday for Strings\" became well-known as the theme for Red Skelton's programs.

She was born in Kolkata, India. She is also known as Sandhya Mukherjee.\n\nSandhya started her music training under the direction of Pandit Santosh Kumar Basu, Professor A Kannan and Professor Chinmay Lahiri. However, her guru was Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan under whom she mastered Indian classical music.\n\nThough classically trained, the bulk of her work consists of Bengali modern songs. She began her career in Mumbai singing Hindi songs, starting with a song in the film Anjan Garh at the age of 17. Following her marriage to the Bengali poet Shyamal Gupta she settled in her home city of Kolkata. Gupta went on to write the lyrics for many of her famous songs.\n\nHer most famous collaboration is arguably with the Bengali singer Hemanta Mukherjee with whom she sang numerous duets, primarily as playback for Bengali films produced from Kolkata. Hemanta and Sandhya became known as the voices behind the pairings of the Bengali superstar Uttam Kumar and his numerous heroines. She also sang several of Salil Chowdhury's hit Bengali songs, such as Ujjwal Ek Jhank Payra, regarded as a classic.\n\nDuring the Bangladesh Liberation War she joined the mass movement among Indian Bengali artistes to raise money for the millions of refugees who had poured into Kolkata and West Bengal to escape the fighting, and to raise global awareness for the cause of Bangladesh. She assisted Bangladeshi musician Samar Das as he set up the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendro, the clandestine radio station broadcasting to Bangladesh and recorded several patriotic songs for him. On the occasion of the release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the imprisoned leader of the new country of Bangladesh, she released a famous song Bangabandhu Tumi Phirey Ele. She later became one of the first foreign artistes to visit Dhaka, performing at an open-air concert in Paltan Maidan in Dhaka to celebrate the first Ekushey February after Bangladeshi independence in 1971.

He achieved international fame for his long list of hit records, including his best-known song \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\", as well as his distinctive voice and phrasing. For the last two decades of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as the greatest living country singer. Country music scholar Bill Malone writes, \"For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.\" Waylon Jennings expressed a similar opinion in his song \"It's Alright\": \"If we all could sound like we wanted to, we'd all sound like George Jones.\" The shape of his nose and facial features earned Jones the nickname \"The Possum\".\n\nBorn in Texas, Jones first heard country music when he was seven, and was given a guitar at the age of nine. He married his first wife, Dorothy Bonvillion, in 1950, and was divorced in 1951. He served in the United States Marine Corps and was discharged in 1953. He married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. In 1959, Jones recorded \"White Lightning\", written by J. P. Richardson, which launched his career as a singer. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1968; he married fellow country music singer Tammy Wynette a year later. Years of alcoholism compromised his health and led to his missing many performances, earning him the nickname \"No Show Jones\". After his divorce from Wynette in 1975, Jones married his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulvado, in 1983 and became sober for good in 1999. Jones died in 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure.\n\nGeorge Jones has been called \"The Rolls Royce Of Country Music\" and had more than 160 chart singles to his name from 1955 until his death in 2013. Johnny Cash once said, \"When people ask me who my favorite country singer is, I say, 'You mean besides George Jones?'\"\n\nJones tirelessly defended the integrity of country music, telling Billboard in 2006, \"It's never been for love of money. I thank God for it because it makes me a living. But I sing because I love it, not because of the dollar signs.\" Jones also went out of his way to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was. \"Everybody knows he's a great singer,\" Alan Jackson stated in 1995, \"but what I like most about George is that when you meet him, he is like some old guy that works down at the gas station...even though he's a legend!\"\n\nShortly after Jones' death, Andrew Mueller wrote about his influence in Uncut, \"He was one of the finest interpretive singers who ever lifted a microphone...There cannot be a single country songwriter of the last 50-odd years who has not wondered what it might be like to hear their words sung by that voice.\" In an article for The Texas Monthly in 1994, Nick Tosches eloquently described the singer's vocal style: \"While he and his idol, Hank Williams, have both affected generations with a plaintive veracity of voice that has set them apart, Jones has an additional gift\u2014a voice of exceptional range, natural elegance, and lucent tone. Gliding toward high tenor, plunging toward deep bass, the magisterial portamento of his onward-coursing baritone emits white-hot sparks and torrents of blue, investing his poison love songs with a tragic gravity and inflaming his celebrations of the honky-tonk ethos with the hellfire of abandon.\" In the New Republic essay \"Why George Jones ranks with Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday,\" David Hajdu writes:\n\n\"Jones had a handsome and strange voice. His singing was always partly about the appeal of the tones he produced, regardless of the meaning of the words. In this sense, Jones had something in common with singers of formal music and opera, though his means of vocal production were radically different from theirs. He sang from the back of his throat, rather than from deep in his diaphragm. He tightened his larynx to squeeze sound out. He clenched his jaw, instead of wriggling it free. He forced wind through his teeth, and the notes sounded weirdly beautiful.\"\n\nDavid Cantwell recalled in 2013, \"His approach to singing, he told me once, was to call up those memories and feelings of his own that most closely corresponded to those being felt by the character in whatever song he was performing. He was a kind of singing method actor, creating an illusion of the real.\" In the liner notes to Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country Rich Kienzle states, \"Jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human. He can turn a ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it, making it a primal, strangled cry of anguish\". In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott pronounced, \"Contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for George Jones. Walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll, George nearly always tops it.\" In the wake of Jones's death, Merle Haggard pronounced in Rolling Stone, \"His voice was like a Stradivarius violin: one of the greatest instruments ever made.\" Emmylou Harris wrote, \"when you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art - always,\" a quote that appeared on the sleeve of Jones' 1976 album The Battle. In the documentary Same Ole Me, several country music stars offer similar thoughts. Randy Travis: \"It sounds like he's lived every minute of every word that he sings and there's very few people who can do that\"; Tom T. Hall: \"It was always Jones who got the message across just right\"; and Roy Acuff: \"I'd give anything if I could sing like George Jones\". In the same film, producer Billy Sherrill states, \"All I did was change the instrumentation around him. I don't think he's changed at all.\"\n\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed George Jones among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/George+Jones\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He played both the trumpet and flugelhorn, and was in demand for his skills as an arranger.\n\nRogers worked first as a professional musician with Will Bradley and Red Norvo. From 1947 to 1949, he worked extensively with Woody Herman and in 1950 and 1951 he played with Stan Kenton.\nRogers appeared on the 1954 Shelly Manne album The Three and the Two along with Jimmy Giuffre. Much of the music he recorded with Giuffre showed his experimental side, resulting in an early form of avant-garde jazz. He also made notable recordings with Art Pepper and Andre Previn, among others.\nFrom 1953 through 1962 Rogers recorded a series of RCA Victor albums (later reissued under the Bluebird label) and Atlantic albums with his own group, Shorty Rogers and His Giants, including Shorty Courts the Count (1954), The Swinging Mr. Rogers (1955), and Martians Come Back (1955), the album title alluding to the tune \"Martians Go Home\" which Rogers had composed and performed on The Swinging Mr. Rogers earlier the same year. These albums incorporated some of his more avant-garde music. To some extent they could be classified as \"cool\" jazz; but they also looked back to the \"hot\" style of Count Basie, whom Rogers always credited as a major inspiration.\nCredited with the composition of the music for UPA's Mr. Magoo cartoon Hotsy Footsy and the Looney Tune Three Little Bops, Rogers eventually became better known for his skills as a composer and arranger than as a trumpeter.\nIn the 1958 Peter Gunn TV series episode The Frog Shorty plays flugelhorn as Lola Albright sings How High the Moon at Mother's.\nAfter the early 1960s Rogers stopped performing on trumpet, and left the jazz scene for many years. Among other composing and arranging activities, he arranged a series of records for The Monkees (including Daydream Believer) in the late 1960s, and in the 1970s wrote the jazzy background score to TV's The Partridge Family during the show's first season. He also contributed episode scores for the fourth season of Starsky & Hutch. Finally, in 1982, he was persuaded to pick up his trumpet and return to performing in jazz ensembles, playing first with Britain\u2019s National Youth Jazz Orchestra and soon with Bud Shank and others. In the 1990s he was part of a Lighthouse All Stars group along with Shank, Bill Perkins, Bob Cooper, Conte Candoli, Claude Williamson, Monty Budwig, and John Guerin. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Shorty+Rogers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Thanh Th\u00fay (born 1943) is a famous Vietnamese singer originally from Hue, Central Vietnam who began her professional singing career around the age of 16 in Saigon and would later become known as Tieng Hat Lieu Trai (The Sultry Singing Voice). \n\nHow Thanh Th\u00fay had become a professional singer was somewhat of an accident, as her career choice had come about unplanned.  Growing up in Hue in a family of 5 siblings, up until her early teenage years Saigon seemed like a faraway destination to Thanh Th\u00fay as a young girl.  However, when she was 15, her mother had been stricken with tuberculosis and the family had to relocate to Saigon for her medical treatment.  To contribute to her family's income along with the high costs of medical care for her mother, Thanh Th\u00fay found work singing at lounges and cabarets while still a minor at age 15, just a few weeks prior to her 16th birthday.  Almost overnight, audiences took notice of her unique style of singing that was unlike most other Vietnamese female vocalists at the time.  Among the characteristics that made her stand out was her husky, sensual singing voice in a much lower register than what was considered typical for a female vocalist along with her distinct style of pronunciation that was reminiscent of the Central Vietnamese dialect most common among native residents of the imperial city of Hue.  One other advantage she had was her natural beauty which coincided with her regal stage presence.\n\nIn a very short period of time, Thanh Th\u00fay by 1960 had become one of the most popular musical performers at cabarets throughout Saigon.  It was at the Duc Quynh Cabaret in Saigon where she first started performing nightly that catapulted Thanh Th\u00fay into Stardom.  Among her many admirers included a list of prominent Vietnamese songwriters.  One particular songwriter by the name of Trinh Cong Son, who was then still a virtual unknown, had been one of her biggest fans.  His very first composition, Uot Mi (Tear Drenched Eyelashes), was written particularly for Thanh Th\u00fay.  It can be said that Trinh Cong Son had been given his first big break as a composer through the introduction of Thanh Th\u00fay's vocal interpretations of Uot Mi which first brought his name to prominence with Vietnamese music audiences.  After the success of Uot Mi, Trinh Cong Son followed up with another composition he had written especially for Thanh Th\u00fay entitled, Thuong Mot Nguoi (To Love Someone).\n\nThroughout her career, Thanh Th\u00fay would have similar experiences with many other prominent Vietnamese composers as many other popular Vietnamese songs had been initially written specifically for Thanh Th\u00fay's singing voice.  Hoang Thi Tho had written Loi Hat Ta On (Lyrics of Thanks) with Thanh Th\u00fay's voice in mind.  Ton That Lap's Tieng Hat Ve Khuya (Nocturnal Voice) had also been written for Thanh Th\u00fay, as well.  Thuy Da Di Roi (Thuy Has Left), the theme song of a 1961 film of the same name directed and written by film actor \/ director Nguyen Long based on Thanh Th\u00fay, was written by Nguyen Long and composed by Y Van had also become one of Thanh Th\u00fay's most famous signature songs throughout her career.  And her most famous collaboration was with songwriter Truc Phuong which had spawned a long list of popular songs for Thanh Th\u00fay such as Hai Loi Mong (Both Sides of Splendor), Nua Dem Ngoai Pho (A Night Out on the Town) and Chuyen Chung Minh (Our Story). \n\nThanh Thuy throughout the 1960s and 1970s in Saigon was one of the most in-demand cabaret headliners, as she graced the stages of major venues like Anh Vu, Tu Do, Queen Bee, and Quoc Te (International), in which she along with one of Saigon's most celebrated promoters, Ngoc Chanh, had each co-owned up until the Fall of Saigon in 1975.  Her tremendous success allowed her to form her own record label simply named as Thanh Thuy which produced and released most of her solo studio albums as well as for various other recording artists of South Vietnam.  In 1962, Thanh Thuy was voted by a national poll conducted by Trang Den Magazine in Saigon as Hoa Hau Nghe Si (Beauty Queen Among Entertainers).  The same magazine would also place her as most popular singer of the year for three consecutive years from 1972-1974.\n\nIn addition to her extraordinary career as a professional singer, Thanh Thuy had also acted in several films produced in South Vietnam.  Among her most popular films included To Tinh (1963), costarring Tham Thuy Hang and La Thoai Tan.\n\nDuring her initial years since her rise to fame, Thanh Thuy broke the hearts of many of her admiring male fans when she decided to get married and start a family of her own.  Happily married to On Van Tai since 1964, Thanh Thuy is a mother to a grown son who is now a pharmacist and since 1995 has been a grandmother.

With his song lyrics, often humorous, often melancholic, and his harsh, passionate voice Vysotsky gained wide popularity despite his criticism of the Soviet government, which considered him a dissident. By the mid-1970s, Vysotsky had been suffering from alcoholism for quite some time. This was also the height of his popularity, when, as described in Marina Vlady's book about her husband, walking down the street on a summer night, one could hear Vystotsky's recognizable voice coming literally from every open window. Unable to completely ignore his musical phenomenon, the state record label Melodiya did release a few of his songs on vinyl in the late 1970s, which, however, constituted only a small portion of his creative work, which millions already owned on tape and knew by heart. In 1980 Vysotsky died, according to the official version, from a heart attack. Thousands of people came to the Taganskaya square to say farewell to the artist, although there were no public note about his death.\n\nMore info in \n Russian official site,\n Russian, English and  quotations <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80+%D0%92%D1%8B%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

At the age of 15, he heard a performance by Fats Domino, an event that \"changed my life forever,\" he recalled.\n\nCharles helped to pioneer the south Louisiana musical genre known as swamp pop. His compositions include the hits See You Later, Alligator, which he initially recorded himself as Later Alligator, but which is best known from the cover version by Bill Haley & His Comets, and Walking to New Orleans, written for Fats Domino.\n\n(I Don't Know Why) But I Do was an early 1960s song that Charles composed, which Clarence \"Frogman\" Henry had a major hit with, and which was on the soundtrack of the 1994 film Forrest Gump. His composition \"Why Are People Like That?\" was on the soundtrack of the 1998 film Home Fries.\n\nBecause of his south Louisiana\u2013influenced rhythm and blues vocal style, Charles has sometimes been thought to be black, when in fact he was white.\n\nCharles was invited to play with the Band at their November 26, 1976, farewell concert, The Last Waltz, at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. In the concert, Charles played \"Down South in New Orleans\", with the help of Dr. John and the Band. That song was recorded and released as part of the triple-LP The Last Waltz box set. The performance was also captured on film by director Martin Scorsese, but did not appear in the final, released theatrical version. Charles did, however, appear briefly in a segment of the released film\u2014in the concert's final song, I Shall Be Released. In that segment, his image is largely blocked from view during the performance. That song, sung by Bob Dylan and pianist Richard Manuel, featured backup vocals from the entire ensemble, including Charles.\n\nHe co-wrote the song Small Town Talk with Rick Danko of the Band. Promises, Promises (The Truth Will Set You Free) was co-written with Willie Nelson.\n\nCharles continued to compose and record (he was based out of Woodstock, New York, for a time) and in the 1990s he recorded a duet of Walking to New Orleans with Domino.\n\nIn September 2007, the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame honored Charles for his contributions to Louisiana music with an induction.\n\nCharles collapsed in his home near Abbeville and died on January 14, 2010.\n\n----------------\n\nBobby Charles was actually born Robert Charles Guidry in Abbeville, Louisiana circa 1938. A regional New Orleans Swamp Pop fave, whose best known song was \"See Ya Later Alligator\". That track became a top 20 hit on Chess records in 1955, after a southern Louisiana record store owner hipped the Chicago based R&B label. Bill Haley may have made the song even more popular and accessible a year later, but Charles was first out the gate. He recorded more early self composed sides for Chess like \"Ain't Gonna Do It No More\" & \"Take It Easy Greasy\", \"No Use Knockin\" featuring hot backing musicians like Lee Allen on sax, Charles Williams on drums and Justin Adams on gtr. \n\nBy 1958, Bobby Charles (aka on songwriting credits as R.Guidry) started releasing material on The Imperial label. After a year of nominal success  on Imperial the Bobby Charles name began showing up mostly doing other writers material on a variety of mainly one off singles on labels like Farie, Hub City, Jewel and Paula until he simply seems to disappear from the record biz circa 1965. \n\nBy 1972, Charles had resurfaced in Woodstock, NY and released three singles from a self titled album on Bearsville in the early 70's, including production and co-writing credits from  Rick Danko of The Band. Bobby Charles later appeared with Dr. John at The Band's 1978 farewell concert captured on film in The Last Waltz.\n\nHe eventually began putting out albums & later CDs on the homespun indie Rice N Gravy imprint. Other musical collaborators with Charles over the Rice N' Gravy years are notables like Neil Young, Dan Penn, Willie Nelson, Sonny Landreth, Derek Trucks, Wardell Quezergue, Rufus Thibodeaux, Fats Domino and Jon Cleary.\n\nCharles most lasting contributions beyond his early Chess rock n roll rave ups, may have been as a songwriter, contributing what some might call Fats Domino's signature tune \"Walkin To New Orleans\", as well as Clarence Frogman Henry's biggest chart hit \"But I Do\". He is basically retired, living in Louisiana near the Gulf of Mexico, but recently shared co-writing credits on six of 13 tracks on the 2008 Dr. John album \"City That Care Forgot\" and came through with \"Homemade Songs\", his first release since his 2004 collection of rarities, \"Last Train to Memphis\". As Bob Dylan said in the liner notes to his 2008 album : 'The boy could sing like a bird. He still does, as a matter of fact.\"\n\nBobby Charles passed away January 14, 2010, at age 71, after collapsing at his home in Abbeville, Louisiana. He was due to release a new album, \"Timeless,\" featuring new material. He saw the final design for the album's artwork, but died only weeks before its scheduled Feb. 23 release. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bobby+Charles\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He was best known for leading a cool jazz octet in the 1950s, the Dave Pell Octet.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York City, Dave Pell first played in his teens with the big bands of Tony Pastor, Bob Astor, and Bobby Sherwood, and then moved to California in the middle of the 1940s. There he played on Bob Crosby's radio show in 1946, and was a member of Les Brown's band from 1947 to 1955.\n\nIn 1953 he began working with his own ensembles, mostly as an octet: Pell on tenor sax, another saxophone (either a baritone or an alto), trumpet and trombone, guitar, and a piano-bass-drums rhythm section). Among the octet players were Pepper Adams, Benny Carter, Mel Lewis, Red Mitchell, Marty Paich, Art Pepper and, early his career, John Williams. These ensembles recorded in the 1950s for Atlantic, Kapp, Coral, Capitol, and RCA Victor; alongside this, he played as a sideman for Shorty Rogers, Pete Rugolo, Benny Goodman, and Gene Krupa. He also produced in the 1950s and 1960s for Tops, Uni and Liberty; among his credits in production were some singles by Gary Lewis & the Playboys.\n\nIn 1961, Pell switched to alto sax and clarinet for I Remember John Kirby, a tribute album to bassist\/bandleader Kirby who led a successful small group in the 1930s and '40s.\n\nPell was the recording session leader for the 1965 hit song \"No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In)\", performed by members of the elite Los Angeles studio musicians known as The Wrecking Crew but attributed to The T-Bones.\n\nIn the 1970s he assembled the group Prez Conference, a Lester Young tribute ensemble. In the 1980s he returned to the octet format, and played on and off into the 1990s.\n\nWhile living in North Hollywood, Dave Pell was married to Babette and had two daughters, Sandra and Suzanne.

He was the eldest son of Vietnam's most prolific songwriter Ph\u1ea1m Duy and singer Th\u00e1i H\u1eb1ng. As a singer, his most popular hit songs included such songs written and\/or composed by his father such as Th\u00e0 Nh\u01b0 Gi\u1ecdt M\u00f9a, Em Hi\u1ec1n Nh\u01b0 Ma Soeur, Chuy\u1ec7n T\u00ecnh Bu\u1ed3n, C\u00f4 B\u1eafc Ky Nho Nh\u1ecf and Hai N\u0103m T\u00ecnh L\u1eadn \u0110\u1eadn. As a songwriter, his most famous song was Ki\u1ebfp \u0110am M\u00ea. Duy Quang had once been married to singer Julie Quang, but never registered his marriage with her lawfully.\n\nBorn on November 4, 1950 in Ha Noi, North Vietnam, Duy Quang was the eldest in a family of eight. When he was just a year old, he and his parents moved to South Vietnam resettling in Saigon. From the age of ten, Duy Quang started learning to play various instruments such as the mandolin, guitar, piano and drums. He began his professional singing career at the age of 17. \n\nAfter forming the pop group, The Dreamers, along with his brother, Duy C\u01b0\u1eddng, his then girlfriend, Julie (later known as Julie Quang) and Veny, Julie's younger sister, Duy Quang began to gain prominence in the year 1969. He and Julie performed as the male lead and female lead singers, respectively, in The Dreamers. Extremely popular with younger audiences, The Dreamers focused primarily in covering top hit songs of Western pop groups such as The Beatles, The Carpenters and The Rolling Stones. At the height of their popularity, The Dreamers headlined nightly at the Ritz in Saigon, a venue headed by singer\/songwriter Jo Marcel.\n\nIn 1970, Duy Quang and Julie Quang welcomed the birth of their daughter, Ly Lan. To commemorate their love, Duy Quang wrote a song called B\u00e0i Th\u01a1 Vu Quy for Julie Quang to record. The song became a hit single upon its release and has since been considered one of Julie Quang's signature songs. This would be the first time that Duy Quang's songwriting skills were introduced to audiences.\n\nDuy Quang moved to France in 1978 to be near his wife, Julie, who had resettled there since 1974. After an absence from live performances since the Fall of Saigon, it was in Paris that year when Duy Quang would make his return to the stage. The couple would move to Southern California a year later to reunite with the rest of Pham Duy's family. They broke up in 1982, but remained friends as Julie would take care of him through later life until his death.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Duy Quang became one of the best selling overseas Vietnamese recording artists. He collaborated with numerous overseas Vietnamese music production labels such as Asia Productions, L\u00e0ng V\u00e2n, Th\u00fay Nga Paris, Kim Ng\u00e2n, Di\u1ec5m X\u01b0a and D\u1ea1 Lan. In 1984, Duy Quang got officially married for the first time to M\u1ef9 H\u00e0, a former resident of Washington, D.C.  During the course of this marriage which lasted 18 years Duy Quang would become a father twice again with the births of their two daughters. He had settled in Midway City with his new family unit in the mid-1980s and built a recording studio inside the family home where he would arrange music and record material for his own music production label, Dream Musical Productions.  Among the most successful studio albums produced and released under Dream Musical Productions include L\u00e0m Sao M\u00e0 Qu\u00ean \u0110\u01b0\u1ee3c (1987), Th\u00e0 Nh\u01b0 Gi\u1ecdt M\u01b0a (1988) and T\u00ecnh Phai (1989), a duet album recorded with singer Ng\u1ecdc Lan. Duy Quang had also recorded duets with numerous other artists including Billy Shane, Nh\u1eadt H\u1ea1, Th\u00e1i Hi\u1ec1n, \u00c1i V\u00e2n, Thanh Mai, H\u01b0\u01a1ng Lan, B\u0103ng Ch\u00e2u, Kim Anh, H\u1ecda Mi, Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng Mai and Jenny Trang. Toward the end of the 1980s decade, Duy Quang and his then wife, M\u1ef9 H\u00e0, had opened a nightclub in Orange County, California called \u0110\u00eam \u0110\u00f4ng Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng. Although the nightclub had been initially successful with many packed nights filled to capacity, the couple began to experience some financial woes and had to close down the venue in the early 1990s. According to Duy Quang, one of the key factors in his financial downfall was his then wife's gambling addiction. The couple divorced in 2002.\n\nAfter making several trips back to Vietnam in the early 2000s where he had enjoyed enormous success performing at live shows for local audiences, Duy Quang contemplated repatriation to his native land. In 2005, he along with his father, Ph\u1ea1m Duy, and brother, Duy Cuong, decided to resettle in Vietnam where they would take over and run a nightclub in H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City called T\u00ecnh V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7. In 2007, a dispute with the owners of T\u00ecnh V\u0103n Ngh\u1ec7 led to Duy Quang and Pham Duy's decision to sever ties and open their own nightclub in which they would name T\u00ecnh Ca. That same year, Duy Quang at age 57 married for the second time to a singer in H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City named Y\u1ebfn Xu\u00e2n. Unfortunately, both the marriage and T\u00ecnh Ca Nightclub were short-lived. Duy Quang and Y\u1ebfn Xu\u00e2n's marriage ended in divorce two years later.\n\nDiagnosed with end stage liver cancer on October of 2012, Duy Quang returned to the United States on November 7th for medical treatment. He died on December 19, 2012. Prior to his death, a sold out event had been held in his honor at Bleu Nightclub in Huntington Beach on December 2nd. Among the celebrities in attendance that night included Elvis Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng, Ki\u1ec3u Nga, Th\u00e1i Ch\u00e2u, Tu\u1ea5n Ng\u1ecdc, Don H\u1ed3, H\u01b0\u01a1ng Lan and Cong Thanh & Lynn.\n\nDuy Quang had come from one of the most famous families in the Vietnamese music industry. His younger sisters, Th\u00e1i Hi\u1ec1n and Th\u00e1i Th\u1ea3o, are both accomplished Vietnamese singers. His brother, Duy C\u01b0\u1eddng, is a famous musician. He is also the nephew of legendary singer Th\u00e1i Thanh and singer\/songwriter Ph\u1ea1m \u0110\u00ecnh Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng. His first cousins include singers Mai H\u01b0\u01a1ng, \u00dd Lan and Qu\u1ef3nh H\u01b0\u01a1ng. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Duy+Quang\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He is best remembered for his million-selling recordings of \"Java\" and the accompanying album Honey in the Horn (1963), and for the theme song to The Green Hornet. His nicknames included \"Jumbo\" and \"The Round Mound of Sound\". Colin Escott, an author of musician biographies, wrote that RCA Victor Records, for which Hirt had recorded most of his best-selling recordings and for which he had spent much of his professional recording career, had dubbed him with another moniker: \"The King.\" Hirt was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in November 2009.\n\nHirt was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of a police officer. At the age of six, he was given his first trumpet, which had been purchased at a local pawnshop. He would play in the Junior Police Band with the children of Alcide Nunez, and by the age of 16, Hirt was playing professionally, often with his friend Pete Fountain. During this time, he was hired to play at the local horse racing track, beginning a six-decade connection to the sport.\n\nIn 1940, Hirt went to Cincinnati, Ohio, to study at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music with Dr. Frank Simon (a former soloist with the John Philip Sousa Orchestra). After a stint as a bugler in the United States Army during World War II, Hirt performed with various swing big bands, including those of Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and Ina Ray Hutton.\n\nIn 1950, Hirt became first trumpet and featured soloist with Horace Heidt's Orchestra. After spending several years on the road with Heidt, Hirt returned to New Orleans working with various Dixieland groups and leading his own bands. Despite Hirt's statement years later \"I'm not a jazz trumpeter and never was a jazz trumpeter\", he made a few recordings where he demonstrated his ability to play in that style, during the 1950s with bandleader Monk Hazel, and a few other recordings on the local Southland Records label.\n\nHirt's virtuoso dexterity and fine tone on his instrument soon attracted the attention of major record labels and he signed with RCA Victor. Hirt posted twenty-two albums on the Billboard charts in the 1950s and 1960s. The albums Honey in the Horn and Cotton Candy were both in the Top 10 best sellers for 1964, the same year Hirt scored a hit single with his cover of Allen Toussaint's tune \"Java\" (Billboard No. 4), and later won a Grammy Award for the same recording. Both Honey in the Horn and \"Java\" sold over one million copies, and were awarded gold discs.\n\nHirt's Top 40 charted hit \"Sugar Lips\" in 1964 would be later used as the theme song for the NBC daytime game show Eye Guess, hosted by Bill Cullen and originally airing from January 1966 to September 1969.\n\nHirt was chosen to record the frenetic theme for the 1960s TV show The Green Hornet, by famed arranger and composer Billy May. Thematically reminiscent of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee, it showcased Hirt's technical prowess. The recording again gained public attention in 2003 when it was used in the film Kill Bill.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s to early 1960s, Hirt and his band played nightly at Dan's Pier 600 at the corner of St. Louis and Bourbon Street. The club was owned by his business manager, Dan Levy, Sr.\n\nAl Hirt club on the corner of Bourbon Street and St Louis in the French Quarter, 1977\nIn 1962 Hirt opened his own club on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, which he ran until 1983. He also became a minority owner in the NFL expansion New Orleans Saints in 1967.\n\nIn 1962, in an effort to showcase him in a different musical setting, Hirt was teamed with arranger and composer Billy May and producer Steve Sholes to record an album titled Horn A Plenty that was a departure from the Dixieland material that he was generally associated with. Covering an eclectic variety of popular, standard and show tunes, it featured a big-band supplemented by timpani, French horns and harp. He also appeared opposite Troy Donahue and Suzanne Phlesette in the 1962 motion picture, \"Rome Adventure.\"\n\nIn 1965, he hosted the hour-long television variety series Fanfare, which aired on CBS as a summer replacement for Jackie Gleason and the American Scene Magazine.\n\nHirt starred along with the University of Arizona marching band at the first Super Bowl halftime show in 1967.\n\nOn February 8, 1970, while performing in a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, Hirt was injured while riding on a float. It is popularly believed that he was struck in the mouth by a thrown piece of concrete or brick. Factual documentation of the details of the incident is sparse, consisting primarily of claims made by Hirt after the incident. Whatever the actual cause of his injuries, Hirt underwent surgery and made a return to the club scene. This incident was parodied in a Saturday Night Live skit from their second season Mardi Gras special, the \"Let's Hit Al Hirt in the Mouth with a Brick Contest\".\n\nIn 1987, Hirt played a solo rendition of \"Ave Maria\" for Pope John Paul II's visit to New Orleans. He is referred to in the 1987 film Good Morning, Vietnam, in a broadcast made by Lieutenant Hauk (Bruno Kirby).\n\nHirt died of liver failure at the age of 76, after having spent the previous year in a wheelchair due to edema in his leg. He was survived by his wife, Beverly Essel Hirt, and six children from a previous marriage. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Al+Hirt\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

With his velvety and low timbre, influenced by Orlando Silva and Nat \"King\" Cole, Peixoto coined an individual style interpreting a kaleidoscope of genres ranging from tongue-in-cheek cheesy boleros to mambo (especially in the early '70s), romantic sambas-can\u00e7\u00f5es (his strongest point) such as his biggest hit \"Concei\u00e7\u00e3o,\" and even a little bossa nova and jazz. Having remained a popular artist for over 50 years, he knew how to renovate his style and keep his aura, also improving his interpretations over the years. Peixoto was paid tribute by many important artists who wrote songs especially for him, such as Tom Jobim (\"Oficina\"), Caetano Veloso (\"Cauby! Cauby!\"), Jorge Benjor (\"Dona Culpa\"), and Roberto Carlos\/Erasmo Carlos (\"Brigas de amor\"). Since 1951, he has recorded over 61 78 rpm, 51 LPs, and 20 CDs, having participated as a singer in over ten films. Cauby Peixoto was raised in a musical environment. His father was a guitar player, his uncle was Non\u00f4 (Romualdo Peixoto). Peixoto also had as a cousin, singer Ciro Monteiro. His siblings are pianist Moacyr Peixoto, trumpeter Arak\u00e9n Peixoto, and singer Andyara. His first public appearance as a singer was at a novice radio show in 1949, in Rio de Janeiro. In that period, he started to sing in nightclubs. The first album came in 1951, with the samba \"Saia Branca\" (Geraldo Medeiros). The next year, he moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, performing in nightclubs and at R\u00e1dio Excelsior. In 1954, he had his first hit, \"Blue Gardenia\" (Bob Russel\/Lester Lee, version by Ant\u00f4nio Almeida\/Jo\u00e3o de Barro). In the same year, Peixoto was invited to join R\u00e1dio Nacional by entrepreneur Di Veras, who devised for him a launching strategy mirrored in the American methods. Some two years later, Peixoto became the idol of the masses, when he had his biggest hit with the samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o \"Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\" (Jair Amorim\/Dunga). He would also have success in that period with \"Nono Mandamento\" (Ren\u00e9 Bittencourt\/Raul Sampaio), \"Prece de Amor\" (Ren\u00e9 Bittencourt), \"Ningu\u00e9m \u00c9 De Ningu\u00e9m\" (Humberto Silva\/Toso Gomes\/Lu\u00eds Mergulh\u00e3o), and \"\u00c9 T\u00e3o Sublime o Amor\" (P. Francis Webster\/Sammy Fain, version by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos). Portrayed by Time and Life magazines, Peixoto was launched in the U.S. under the stage name Ron Coby, where he recorded with Paul Weston and Percy Faith's orchestras. In 1959, Peixoto had another season in the U.S. (14 months), where he recorded \"Maracangalha\" (Dorival Caymmi) in the English version (\"I Go\"). From 1964 to 1968, he dedicated himself to perform with his siblings at his celebrated Drink nightclub, having recorded a live LP there with Leny Eversong. In 1970, he won the San Remo Festival (Italy) with \"Z\u00edngara\" (R. Alberteli, version by Nazareno de Brito). From the late '60s to the late '70s, he was considered dated, compared to the vigorous movements of that period devoted to the younger generations in Brazil. Sensible to the audience's reaction, Peixoto adopted a more theatrical\/extravagant style in his outfits and scenic persona, and a more restrained and \"classical\" identity in his vocal renditions that again brought him the public's interest. It was around 1979 when he participated with \"Bolero de Sat\u00e3\" on Elis Regina's album. Cauby! Cauby! (1980), the commemorative LP of his 25-year of career, represented a complete renovation of his standard repertory, with songs by Caetano Veloso, Roberto Carlos\/Erasmo Carlos, and the hits \"Loucura\" (Joanna\/Sarah Benchimol) and \"Bastidores\" (Chico Buarque). From then on, he enjoyed stable success. Rediscovered by critics, Peixoto and \u00c2ngela Maria were paid tribute at the 1993 Pr\u00eamio Sharp award ceremony. In 1995, Dionne Warwick, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, and Zizi Possi participated on his CD Cauby Canta Sinatra. ~ Alvaro Neder, All Music Guide <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Cauby+Peixoto\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

After graduating from high school, she went on to graduate from the University of Saigon, School of Literature in 1973.  Thanh Lan began her music career from the early age of 9 when she was taken under the wings of musicians Tham Oanh and Nghiem Phu Phi who guided her on her beginnings on the road to fame.  While still in high school, she appeared regularly on VTVN Radio as part of the group, Viet Nhi, directed by Nguyen Duc.  \n\nFrom 1967 to 1968, Thanh Lan appeared on Truyen Hinh Sai Gon singing folkloric Vietnamese music.  In college, Thanh Lan gained national fame as a singer of popular music.  In 1970, she starred in her first motion picture, Tieng Hat Hoc Tro.  In 1973, she toured Japan with musicians Ngoc Chanh and Pham Duy where her recordings of the songs, Tuoi Biet Buon and Tuoi Mong Mo, were featured at the International Music Festival of Yamaha.  Among Thanh Lan's most popular films prior to the Fall of Saigon include Le Da (Tears of a Stone) (1971), Ganh Hang Hoa (Carried Load of Flowers) (1972), both starring La Thoai Tan, Xin Dung Bo Em (Please Don't Desert Me) (1973) starring Tham Thuy Hang, and Number Ten Blues (1975), later renamed as Goodbye Saigon upon its re-release in 2014, a Japanese film directed by acclaimed filmmaker Norio Osada.  Goodbye Saigon was featured at the Vietnam International Film Festival held on April 12, 2014 in Orange County, California.\n\nAfter 1975, Thanh Lan continued with both her careers in music and films for many years.  From 1984 until 1987, she replaced actress Thuy An in the role portrayal of Thuy Dung in the last five sequels of the wildly successful movie series, Van Bai Lat Ngua, starring opposite Nguyen Chanh Tin.  In 1990, she was cast as leading actress in Ben Kia Man Suong, a Vietnamese-American produced movie directed by Le Tuan and costarred singer\/actress Nhat Ha.  In 1993, Thanh Lan starred in another movie produced and directed by Le Tuan, Tinh Nguoi, which costarred overseas Vietnamese singer ZaZa Minh Thao.  Prior to leaving her homeland, Thanh Lan was enjoying a thriving singing career with a full nightly performing schedule at major venues in Ho Chi Minh City such as the Rex Hotel, Nha Hat Thanh Pho (Saigon Opera House), Hoa Binh Municipal Theater and the Caravelle.  She was also recording for various major record labels in Vietnam like Ben Thanh Audio, Saigon Audio and Vafaco.  Then at the end of 1993 Thanh Lan traveled to the United States for what had been planned originally as a brief tour would ultimately lead to her seeking political asylum at beginning of the year in 1994.  She has since remained active as a pop music performer in the overseas Vietnamese community and continues to be in high demand to this day.\n\nAmong Thanh Lan's most popular songs have included Tinh Thien Thu, Khi Xua Ta Be (Bang Bang), Em Dep Nhat Dem Nay (La Plus Belle Pour Aller Danser), Trung Vuong Khung Cua Mua Thu (Tell Laura I Love Her), Tinh Yeu Oi Tinh Yeu (Oh Mon Amour) and Mua Dong Cua Anh, in which she had recorded as a duet with legendary singer \/ songwriter Nhat Truong.  Since resettling in the United States, she has continued with numerous audio recordings and video appearances in collaboration with some of the biggest overseas Vietnamese production labels such as May Productions, Thuy Anh, Diem Xua, Lang Van, Asia Entertainment and Thuy Nga Paris.  Among Thanh Lan's most memorable appearances on the Paris By Night stage during the 1990s were her performances of several Pham Duy-penned songs like Con Quy Lay Chua Tren Troi, Tra Lai Em Yeu, Ky Vat Cho Em and Chiec Bong Ben Duong.  To date, her last appearance on Paris By Night was on volume 50 in 1999 where she performed a duet medley of popular French love songs with Elvis Phuong.  Thanh Lan has appeared on video performing similar medleys of popular French love songs known as Lien Khuc Nhac Phap for Asia Entertainment on three other volumes of the live show series.  Perhaps the most well received of these French medleys partaken by Thanh Lan was in 1996 as part of a trio with two other iconic French-language Vietnamese singers, Jo Marcel and Julie Quang.  In 2008, she would team up with Paolo Tu\u1ea5n to repeat the same theme, a medley of French torch songs, and again in 2012 as a trio alongside Sy Dan and Vu Tuan Duc.\n\nThanh Lan was once married and divorced while in Saigon during the early 1970s.  A daughter had come from that marriage, whom she affectionately had given the nickname, \"Boo\".  Sometime after Thanh Lan's resettlement to the United States, Boo, then already a young adult, also made the decision to leave Vietnam and take up permanent residence in Australia. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Thanh+Lan\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He toured Europe with different musicians, among them were the guitarist Rafael Iriarte, the pianist Juan Cruz Mateo and the bandleader Jos\u00e9 Melin. His duos with Carmencita Aubert were very successful and were often committed to record.

He moved later to Italy where he recorded several discs with the Canaro orchestra for the Cetra label. In 1943 he returned to Spain again with Bianco. Soon thereafter he put together his own orchestra and signed a contract with Odeon which meant spectacular record sales for that time. Lola Membrives offered him the chance to appear in Buenos Aires where he was hired by Radio El Mundo. He stayed several years in Argentina and appeared in other countries of the southern hemisphere. He came back to Spain in 1948 where he went on singing, especially boleros and tangos. In the fifties his career began to decline and he retired in 1954 but he came back shortly in 1960 to record four tangos.

Enjoying a string of 'countrypolitan' hit songs throughout the 80s, he's best known for the 1983 ballad \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" as well as for his famous role in the critically acclaimed 'Les Mis\u00e9rables' musical, with Morris playing Jean Valjean for many years on stage and also starring in its internationally popular 1989 soundtrack album. He's been successful in other acting gigs as well. \n\nGary Morris was born as Gary Gwyn Morris in Ft. Worth, Texas in 1948. He had two siblings, a twin sister and a younger brother. Even though Morris has become best-known for pop-oriented hits, he was descended from a long line of traditional country singers who sang twang-heavy, roots-inspired country as well as gospel music. While in the third grade, Morris and his sister won a talent show contest by singing their rendition of the Rosemary Clooney gem \"This Old House\". Morris was very athletic in high school and played four sports there, leading to a scholarship with Cisco Junior College in Texas. \n\nAround the same time, however, music began to utterly fascinate Morris. Rather than play sports, he decided instead to move to Colorado and try making a career out of performing. He and two friends formed a trio and began singing. When the band asked a Colorado Springs bartender if they could get up on the bandstand and perform a few songs, the audience's response (and tips) convinced Morris to put his college plans on hold to pursue a full performing career. During this time, Morris made a living singing in nightclubs around Denver, Colorado. He also wrote a few commercial jingles for Frontier Airlines. \n\nIn 1976, when presidential candidate Jimmy Carter was running for office, Morris signed on with the campaign and sang at fundraisers for him. After Carter won the election, Morris performed at the White House. Fatefully, the audience featured Nashville Country music producer Norro Wilson. Later on, Morris presented Wilson with a demo tape, and Wilson loved what he heard. In no time, Morris was signed to Wilson's label, Warner Bros. Records. \n\nMorris soon began recording for Warner Bros. In 1981, he finally landed his first Top 10 hit with \"Headed for a Heartache\". Fans greatly enjoyed his emotive, passionate take on the contemporary country sound. The following year he had two more Top 20 country hits, titled \"Don't Look Back\" and \"Dreams Die Hard\". These hits were all up-tempo tracks, a format which seemed to be working well for Morris, but he decided to focus on a slower pace after that. In 1983 he released his 'ballad' album, which he titled 'Why Lady Why'. It yielded several radio hits such as the title track, \"Velvet Chains,\" and \"The Love She Found in Me\". Yet none proved as successful as the smash hit \"The Wind Beneath My Wings,\" a track that immediately became his signature song\u2014 and still remains so today. The song was later popularized even more when singer Bette Midler covered it for her 1988 film Beaches.\n\nThe year 1983 proved to be one of the busiest and most successful for Morris in the country music industry. In addition to releasing a best-selling album, he revived the career of '70s country recording artist Lynn Anderson with their duet called \"You're Welcome to Tonight,\" which became a Top 10 hit. The next year Morris won a spate of awards for his achievements and appeared as a guest on several daytime and primetime television shows as well. \n\nNot content to rest after this initial success, Morris continued recording and set his sights even higher. In 1984 he saw his first #1 country hit with the single \"Baby Bye Bye\" and achieved two other top ten hits with \"Second Hand Heart\" and \"Between Two Fires.\" The following year brought Morris a second  #1 with \"I'll Never Stop Loving You.\" He also lent his voice to soundtrack work, recording a duet with songbird Crystal Gayle called \"Another World,\" which was used as the theme song for the American soap opera of the same name. Morris also had another big hit with \"Lasso the Moon\" from the western comedy film Rustlers' Rhapsody. \n\nMorris's songs during this era were mainly pop-oriented country tunes, part of a popular movement in country music at that time which came to be known as Countrypolitan. It used an \"urban cowboy\" approach, adding the glossy production typical of pop music to what were essentially country numbers. Other examples of this sound were artists such as Larry Gatlin, Janie Fricke, Crystal Gayle, Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Alabama, and Eddie Rabbitt. Some of these acts even had crossover success onto the pop music charts, although Morris never had the fortune there that some of his counterparts did. \n\nGary Morris continued to generate a string of hits that refused to dry up until the late 1980s. More charting singles from this period include \"Honeycomb,\" \"100% Chance of Rain,\" \"Finishing Touches,\" and \"Leave Me Lonely,\" his last #1. Morris scored his final hit with \"Plain Brown Wrapper\" in 1987. After that, his success on the country charts quickly faded as a wave of New Traditionalist artists \u2014 chief among them George Strait, Dwight Yoakam, and Randy Travis \u2014 spurred a return to the genre's roots in honky tonk and western swing, sending the once-popular Countrypolitan fad into rapid decline. But not before Morris had scored an overall career sixteen Top 10 country hits for himself. \n\nAfter his career in country music ended, Morris decided to move right along into another career. This time, he chose acting. One of his first roles came when he was cast in the much-coveted lead role of Jean Valjean in the traveling production of Les Mis\u00e9rables, the celebrated Boublil-Sch\u00f6nberg stage adaptation based on the Victor Hugo novel about the French revolution. Featuring Gary's now-famous version of \"Bring Him Home,\" the full symphonic recording of Les Mis\u00e9rables became a platinum-selling, Grammy Award-winning album. Theater proved a successful medium for Morris; in addition to Les Mis, he appeared in a production of Puccini's opera La Boh\u00e8me with fellow country singer Linda Ronstadt. \n\nThroughout the 1990s he spent time working on various music projects, like the PBS special concert production in Moscow, Russia in the famous Tretyakov Gallery. He hosted and produced the Nashville Network's top-rated \"The North American Sportsman\" program. He also returned to performing concerts of his country hits and even tried his hand at record producing. \n\nToday, Gary Morris spends much time at his fishing resort lodge in southern Colorado called the Mountain Spirit Lodge. He currently has four children (all boys), and his son Matthew is also a singer.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Gary+Morris\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

For many, she is too closely linked to Italian versions of hits by Belgium\u2019s singing nun, big but uninspiring ballads and, later, Schlager, folk and even children\u2019s songs. But a deeper delve into her back catalogue reveals some great tracks from this underrated star. \n\nShe was born Orietta Galimberti on 1 June 1945 in Cavriago, in the Reggio Emilia region of Italy. Her father was an opera buff and he encouraged his daughter to sing from a very early age. She went on to study music and singing. \n\nIn 1961, she tied for first place with Iva Zanicchi\u00a0in a song contest and was offered a recording contract with the Karim label. However, her first two 45s, Non ci sar\u00f2\u00a0and Se non avessi pi\u00f9, both issued in 1962, failed to attract much attention. \n\nThe following year she switched to the Polydor label, where she would remain for the next 15 years.\n\nSerenata surbana\u00a0\u2013 originally a South American tune \u2013 became her debut release for the new label, though she achieved greater notoriety in 1964 with her version of Soeur Sourire\u2019s Dominique. Its success even prompted a whole album of covers of the Belgian nun\u2019s songs. (Imagine.)\n\nIt was a surprise, then, when Polydor opted to issue the poppier Tutto \u00e8 finite fra noi\u00a0as the follow up 45. The real gem of the release, however, was the B-side, Vai, Bobby, vai, a cover of Lesley Gore\u2019s US hit Run, Bobby, run. \n\nPerdendoti, a version of Brenda Lee\u2019s Losing you, backed with Scorderai\u00a0(Dusty Springfield\u2019s Stay awhile), became Orietta\u2019s final single of 1964. \n\nA win at the Un disco per l\u2019estate in 1965 with Tu sei quello\u00a0gave the singer her first big hit, reaching number two in the charts that July. It also marked a change in style \u2013 big ballads were in, pop was consigned to B-sides. In this case, another Gore song, No more tears, retitled Se per caso, became the flip. \n\nSimilarly, the beat gem Le ragazze semplici\u00a0lingered on the reverse of the ballad Voglio dirti grazie, her winning song from the Rose festival of 1965. \n\nOrietta\u2019s popularity afforded her a place at the prestigious San Remo contest in January 1966, where she performed Io ti dar\u00f2 di pi\u00f9, which made it to the final, though it didn\u2019t win. However, she lost out in a chart war with Ornella Vanoni, who had also performed the song at the contest. \n\nPolydor were keen to promote their new star abroad, and Orietta was whisked into the studio to \nre-record some of her hits for the Spanish market. Her San Remo entry became Yo te dar\u00eca mas\u00a0for her first Spanish-language release. (A similar push was made in France the following year, though without any great success.)\n\nAt home, further ballads, Quando la prima stella\u00a0and Dove, non so\u00a0(the theme from the film Dr Zhivago), consolidated her success. A second LP was also issued, which included her hits to date and some new material, notably Quando partirai, a version of Brit girl Lesley Duncan\u2019s When my baby cries. \n\nFrom then on, Orietta trod the well-worn path of song contest after song contest. \n\n1967 brought success with Io, tu e le rose\u00a0(at San Remo), Solo tu\u00a0(at Un disco per l\u2019estate), Ritorner\u00e0 da me\u00a0(Festivalbar) and Io potrei (Rose festival). In the UK, Cliff Richard enjoyed a top ten hit with his cover of her Solo tu, All my love. \n\nIf Orietta was disappointed to be eliminated before the final of the 1968 San Remo contest with Tu che non sorridi mai, she found consolation by finishing second at Un disco per l\u2019estate with the catchy Non illuderti mai. The song went on to enjoy a 12-week run in the top ten of the charts during the summer that year. \n\nShe also enjoyed some success with Se m\u2019innamoro di un ragazzo come te, from the Canzonissima, and even appeared as a nun in the film Zum, zum, zum.\n \nThe hits continued for the remainder of the decade with the dramatic Quando l\u2019amore diventa poesia\u00a0(from the 1969 San Remo festival), L\u2019atalena\u00a0(Un disco per l\u2019estate) and Una bambola blu\u00a0(Canzonissima). \n\nThe collective social conscience of the early 1970s saw Orietta tackle some tough issues through her songs, including feminism, prostitution and immigration. \n\nIn 1973, she moved into performing folk songs \u2013 enjoying success with the results \u2013 before taking several acting roles in films such as 1978\u2019s Quando c\u2019era lui... caro lei!\n\nAfter a foray into performing songs for children, she returned to the San Remo stage in 1986 with Futuro. \n\nIn the 1990s, Orietta became a familiar face on Italian TV screens as a presenter, and she continues to issue the occasional album.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Orietta+Berti\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He was named after the famous general, Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, who was an ancestor.His most popular song was \"Waterloo\" in 1959. The song is a haunting and catchy tune that states that \"Everybody has to meet his Waterloo,\" meaning their fate or comeuppance. The song cites Adam, Napoleon and Tom Dooley as examples.\n\nJackson was the first to join the Grand Ole Opry before he got a recording contract. He signed to Columbia Records and debuted in 1958 with \"Don't Be Angry.\" The song didn't score in the country music top 40, but it got him recognition.His breakthrough came in the country Top 40 in late 1958, with a song written by a young George Jones, \"Life to Go.\" It peaked at #2 in early 1959 and his follow-up record, \"Waterloo,\" was #1 for 5 weeks and crossed over into the Top 40 Pop charts, where it reached #4. His next #1 came in 1964, with \"B.J. The D.J.\" (about an over-worked country music radio station DJ, who crashes his car in a rainstorm because of bad tires). Jackson was the first to record a live record from the Grand Ole Opry, in 1963 with \"Old Showboat.\" Other classics include \"The Carpet On The Floor,\" \"Why I'm Walkin',\" \"A Wound Time Can't Erase\" and \"I Washed My Hands in Muddy Water.\" Jackson also recorded a cover of Lobo's 1971 hit, \"Me and You and a Dog Named Boo.\"\n\nFrom 1958 to 1971, Jackson had 35 Top 40 Country Hits. Along with Ray Price, Jackson is considered a cornerstone, after Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell, in the hard-driving honky tonk sound in the late 50's and early 60's.\n\nIn 2006, Jackson sued the Grand Ole Opry for $10 million, claiming age discrimination. As a member of the Opry for over fifty years, Jackson believed that management was sidelining him in favor of younger artists. In his court filing, Jackson claimed that Grand Ole Opry general manager, Pete Fisher, stated that he didn't \"want any gray hairs on that stage or in the audience, and before I'm done there won't be any.\" Fisher is also alleged to have told Jackson that he was \"too old and too country.\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Stonewall+Jackson\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

There, he engaged his twin fantasies of riding horses and operating a private museum devoted to the saddles, books, rifles and guns of the American west.

His first album 'Sounds off' was released in Richmond in 2000 and co-produced by his longtime friends Jason Horst (Jason and the vacations) and Josh Scolaro (Aircraft). In Memphis David works as a tour guide at the legendary Sun Studio (Elvis, Johny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis) during the day while constantly writing and playing gigs at night. 'End of an Error' (2003) was a great step forward in terms of songwriting and has recently been licensed by Starbucks to play in some of their 6000 stores worldwide. In 2005 'Chorus verses the bridge' was released, and David also married and had a daughter in that same year. In Feb 2007 David went on a solo acoustic tour of the United Kingdom, his first tour outside of the midsouth. He played dates in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Oxford, Leicester and London along the way. His gig at the Cavern Club in Liverpool where the Beatles began their career marked a highlight in his young career. A month before the tour, his fourth album 'Obsessed' (2007) was released to the strongest reviews to date. 2007 also marked Davids' 4th year as a tour guide at Sun Studio, which has helped him out tremendously with meeting people from all over the world.

After graduating from high school, she enrolled at University of Saigon, School of Law in 1971.  It was there where she actively involved in performing arts singing for various music programs put together by the university.  In between semesters, she also enrolled in a few classes at Quoc Gia Am Nhac, Saigon Conservatory of Music and befriended a fellow student by the name of Bui Thien who would become her voice coach.  At the beginning of her sophomore year at University of Saigon, School of Law she would meet the legendary songwriter\/composer\/show promoter, Hoang Thi Tho, who was instantaneously taken by her clear, sweet singing voice.  Through his personal invitation, she became a regular performer in his revue at the prestigious Maxim's Cabaret in Saigon.  She then became known as Son Ca, a name that Hoang Thi Tho highly approved of which was also the name of one of her father's former girlfriends.  In a short period of time, Son Ca gained national prominence through her appearances on Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng Tr\u00ecnh Ho\u00e0ng Thi Th\u01a1 , a popular television and program hosted by the musician himself.  She also became a frequent guest on another popular television show, Ngh\u1ec7 S\u0129 V\u1edbi Chi\u1ebfn S\u0129, produced by Nguyen Dinh Toan.  \n\nIn 1974, Son Ca recorded her first studio album which was self-titled and produced by Nguyen Van Dong for the Continental record label in South Vietnam.  Among her most well-received songs from the debut album included M\u00f9a Thu Cho Em written by Ngo Thuy Mien, B\u00e2y Gi\u1edd Th\u00e1ng M\u1ea5y? written by Tu Cong Phung and all three versions of H\u00f2n V\u1ecdng Phu written by Le Thuong.  Son Ca also recorded for other major record labels in South Vietnam including Viet Nam and Shotguns.  Her name became linked with a string of hit songs Hoang Thi Tho had written especially for her to record such as \u0110\u00e1m C\u01b0\u1edbi Tr\u00ean \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng Qu\u00ea, R\u01b0\u1edbc T\u00ecnh V\u1ec1 V\u1edbi Qu\u00ea H\u01b0\u01a1ng, T\u00ecnh Ca Tr\u00ean L\u00faa and G\u1ea1o Tr\u1eafng Tr\u0103ng Thanh.  Among her other popular songs included G\u00e1nh L\u00faa written by Pham Duy, Duy\u00ean N\u01b0\u1edbc T\u00ecnh Tr\u0103ng written by Hoang Nguyen, T\u00e0u V\u1ec1 Qu\u00ea H\u01b0\u01a1ng written by Hong Van and what would become known as her signature song, C\u00f4 Th\u1eafm V\u1ec1 L\u00e0ng written by Giao Tien which she had recorded for the Shotguns label as a duet with singer Thai Chau.  Right around this time, Son Ca teamed up with her former classmate and close friend, Bui Thien, to become one of the most popular singing duos in South Vietnam.  Their most popular hit song recorded together was \u0110\u01b0a Em Qua C\u00e1nh \u0110\u1ed3ng V\u00e0ng written by Hoang Thi Tho.  \n\nAfter the Fall of Saigon in 1975, Son Ca continued her career as a singer collaborating with theater troupes headed by Kim Cuong and by Tham Thuy Hang.  In 1976, she married and started a family with the birth of a daughter the following year.  In the summer of 1979, she along with her husband, young daughter and a younger sister fled from communist Vietnam by boat landing at a refugee camp in Thailand where they remained for six months before resettling in the United States on January of 1980.\n\nDuring their first year in the United States, Son Ca and her family lived in San Jose, California.  In 1981, she along with her husband and their 4-year-old daughter relocated to Houston, Texas for work as they helped run and operate a gas station\/convenience store owned by a family friend.  After three years living in Houston, Son Ca decided to resume her singing career and packed up for Orange County, Calfornia, home of the largest concentrated Vietnamese-American population.  With the money she had saved up during the previous years working in Houston, Son Ca took a gamble and produced a studio album in 1984 entitled as Ti\u1ebfng H\u00e1t S\u01a1n Ca H\u1ea3i Ngo\u1ea1i and distributed by Thanh Lan music production label.  The gamble would pay off as her first album produced overseas would generate a sizable profit for Son Ca as it sold quite well within overseas Vietnamese communities across the United States and abroad.  From 1984 until 1990, Son Ca produced over a dozen studio albums which also featured recordings by various overseas Vietnamese singers such as Bui Thien, Khanh Ly, Thanh Tuyen, Phuong Dung, Giao Linh, Huong Lan, Lilian and Phuong Hoai Tam.  She also toured extensively performing at live shows for overseas Vietnamese audiences all over the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia.  \n\nSon Ca has appeared on music videos for various overseas Vietnamese production labels such as Diem Quynh, Van Nghe Viet Nam, Washington Night, Thuy Nga Paris and Asia Entertainment.  She first appeared on the popular Paris By Night video series produced by Thuy Nga Paris in 1986 for volumes 2 and 3 performing Th\u01b0\u01a1ng Qu\u00e1 Vi\u1ec7t Nam written by Pham The My and Lien Khuc Tinh Ca, respectively.  Eleven years later, she would be invited back on the Paris By Night stage for volumes 41 and 47, both of which were filmed in Toronto, Canada paying tribute to the music of Hoang Thi Tho.  Son Ca's last Paris By Night performance to date was in a duet with Thai Chau, B\u00e0i Ng\u1ee3i Ca Qu\u00ea H\u01b0\u01a1ng for volume 83 released in 2006.  For Asia Entertainment, Son Ca has appeared on volumes 65-68 which were filmed from 2010 until 2011 with performances of songs such as R\u01b0\u1edbc T\u00ecnh V\u1ec1 V\u1edbi Qu\u00ea H\u01b0\u01a1ng in a duet with singer Ngoc Huyen, Vi\u1ec7t Nam \u01a0i! Ng\u00e0y Vui \u0110\u00e3 T\u1edbi, Ng\u00e0y Xu\u00e2n Vui C\u01b0\u1edbi in a duet with Chi Tam and Saigon, performed as a trio with Phuong Hong Que and Bang Chau.\n\nIn 1990, Son Ca's marriage of 14 years ended in divorce.  Five years later, she remarried to an Australian citizen of Vietnamese descent and moved to Brisbane, Australia.  In recent years, Son Ca has been actively involved in Thi\u1ec1n Ca Vo-Vi, a non-profit organization which promotes spiritual enrichment, and performs for many of the organization's benefit live shows around the world. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/S%C6%A1n+Ca\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

She was born in Copenhagen, and grew up in a little apartment in the poor central part of the city. Her parents had immigrated to Denmark from Russia at the start of the 1900s. Her father was a tailor, and her mother was a seamstress.\n\nShe started her career as a dancer in the Helsing\u00f8r Revue in 1936 and had her debut as a singer in 1938, when she was also broadcast on radio for the first time. She sang with various orchestras through the early 1940s and in 1940 formed her own swing trio. That same year her first record was released. She also toured during these years in Sweden.\n\nAs a Jew, she fled Denmark in October 1943 along with her family, as the country had come under Nazi occupation. She spent the war years in Sweden where she continued having great success with her career, performing with orchestras and in cabarets and varieties. Her jazz singing style has been compared to that of Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nShe returned to Denmark in 1945 and in the years that followed she became Denmark's leading female ballad singer. Among her successes were Vovsen i vinduet (\"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\") in 1953 and Heksedansen (\"The Witch Dance\") in 1960. Her best-selling song was Hele ugen alene (\"All week alone\") in 1953 which sold over 120,000 copies. She was the first artist in Denmark to earn a gold record. She continued to garner awards throughout her career.\n\nIn addition to her Danish language recordings, she recorded also in Swedish, Yiddish and Hebrew.\n\nAfter qualifying in the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix to represent Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest, she participated in Eurovision Song Contest 1958 where she sung Jeg rev et blad ud af min Dagbog (I Tore A Page Out Of My Diary). She ranked number 8.\n\nShe participated once more in the Danish Melodi Grand Prix, singing a duet with Grethe S\u00f8nck entitled Hjemme hos os (\"At our home\").\n\nIn the late 1980s she retired from public life. She died in Skodsborg in the northern part of Sj\u00e6lland on the day before her 83rd birthday.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Raquel+Rastenni\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

They started out as a party orchestra playing cover material, but became a regional legend when they released two LPs of self-penned popular folk songs, sung in the regional dialect in the early 1980s.\n\n2. De Vrijbuiters (1983-2010) was a trio from the Dutch province of Zuid-Holland, originally consisting of Kees Verkaik, Leo Mudde and bassist Frans Kieboom.

His singing career began in 1951, after he came first place in a singing competition. He signed a recording contract with Durium Records to record songs in Italian and Napulitano. The following year, with the song \"Rose, poveri rrose!\", he came first in the Castellammare di Stabia music festival, and decided to become a professional singer.\n\nHis first big hit was with \"Scapricciatiello\", by Pacifico Vento and Ferdinando Albano, in 1954.[2] In 1957 his song \"Lazzarella\" (written by Domenico Modugno and Riccardo Pazzaglia) was a success at the Naples song festival (Festival d'a Canzone Napulitana) and the eponymous film which followed (directed by Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia), in which he performed, was also a great success with the public. In the following years, he took part in the San Remo song festival six times and toured worldwide, which contributed to his success abroad in the United States, South America and Japan. He was the singer of the winning song at the Naples song festival in 1961, 1965 and 1969.\nHis best-known songs are probably \"Guaglione\", recorded in 1956, and \"A pizza\" (by Alberto Testa and Bruno Martelli), from the Naples song festival of 1966.\n\nHe opened a restaurant in Naples, A canzuncella, where he entertained the patrons.[5] He studied the Neapolitan language (Napulitano) and published a grammar (Grammatica della lingua napoletana) and a book on Neapolitan legends (Fiabe e leggende napoletane).

He started a band called, \"The Clique\" as the vocalist and guitarist. However, the band struggled and dj honda was forced to seek additional employment. He began djing at the popular nightclubs in a small nearby city, Shizuoka where he was first introduced to hip hop music and various turntable techniques, including scratching & beat juggling. Ultimately, DJ Honda landed premiere gigs in Tokyo's largest clubs while he perfecting his turntable techniques. By this time, he had created a popular name for himself as a DJ. DJ Honda also appeared on Tokyo radio stations and remixed popular tracks for local record companies. \n\nAfter entering New York City's New Music Seminar's \"Battle for World Supremacy\" in 1992 and placing runner up, DJ Honda made an international splash. After the success of this battle under his belt, DJ Honda decided to move to L.A. to make a buzz for himself in the U.S. It was here where DJ Honda forged notable contacts such as Ice T, Eazy E, Tha Alkaholiks, Xzibit & many other West Coast talents.  Sony Music Japan then approached DJ Honda for a recording contract where he eventually released two albums: \"H, DJ Honda\" & \"H II\". This signing caused DJ Honda to move once again to New York City. He was ahead of his time in Japan at this stage.  After securing this new recording contract with Sony, DJ Honda launched his signature \"H, DJ Honda\" collection including the infamous \"h\" baseball caps, men's clothing, accessories such as sunglasses, neck ties, umbrellas, shoe line, wallets, etc. In New York City, he cultivated many valuable relationships with artists like Melle Mel, Grandmaster Caz, Prince Whipper Whip, Universal Zulu Nation including Afrika Bambaata well as some of the emcees who would later be featured on his self-titled debut LP, \"H, DJ Honda\": Common, Redman, Gang Starr, Fat Joe, Biz Markie, JuJu & Psycho Les of The Beatnuts, Brand Nubian's Grand Puba & Sadat X, & more.  With the success of \"H, DJ Honda\" album released in U.S. and Japan Versions, DJ Honda makes a quantum leap from his debut album to his sophomore compilation, \"H II\" which featured acclaimed emcees such as Mos Def, KRS-One, The Beatnuts, Cuban Link, Keith Murray, De La Soul, Missin' Linx, & more. \"Trouble In the Water\", the first single from H II album was a masterpiece between emcee and producer: De La Soul and DJ Honda.  The second single from H II was DJ Honda & Mos Def's collabo, \"Travellin' Man\" which became a hit single world wide with having its music video playing from Brazil to South Africa. DJ Honda is extremely well liked by American emcees.

En Mayo de 1999 publica su primer maxisingle Tropiezos y Pasos producido por GRIFFI (Solo Los Solo). PAYO MALO se gana el respeto de los mcs y bboys espa\u00f1oles y la admiraci\u00f3n de los fans de este genero. Su segundo maxisingle In depleis tuvy, tambi\u00e9n producido por GRIFFI, tuvo unas ventas considerables y le consagr\u00f3 como una de las grandes promesas del hip hop nacional. Con su disco debut Con tierra en los bolsillos producido por GIRO ER NENE disco que super\u00f3 una de las primeras barreras en lo que a ventas se refiere alcanzando m\u00e1s de 10.000 copias algo inpensable por aquella \u00e9poca. Su ultimo maxisingle Con un ojo en la espalda fue un gran \u00e9xito de ventas desde la primera semana, le hicieron colocarse en el n\u00ba 2 de la Lista Afyve. El cambio, quiz\u00e1s provocado por su nuevo productor ERREZE. Sin perder la rima, el flow y la actitud que han hecho del Payo Malo lo que es hoy, la madurez musical y personal se nota. El crecimiento imparable de este artista y su facilidad para superar cualquier barrera musical esta claramente plasmado en lo que ser\u00e1 su pr\u00f3ximo disco. En su esperado trabajo \"EQUILIBRIO\" Payo Malo se aleja del rap de estudio y Shico Shanante (ERREZE) ahonda en terrenos poco explorados por los productores de la escena hip hop nacional. Grabado durante los meses de Agosto y Septiembre en los estudios Soul y Sombra de Barcelona, EQULIBRIO incluye 18 nuevos cortes que nos muestran a un PAYO MALO en constante evoluci\u00f3n dentro de su g\u00e9nero, esta vez de la mano de su productor Shico Shanante (ERREZE). Con este disco, PAYO MALO nos demuestra lo importante que es el equilibrio entre m\u00fasica , letra y t\u00e9cnica, los tres ingredientes que componen una canci\u00f3n. Fallar en uno de \u00e9stos, hace tambalearse al equilibrista en su propia cuerda. Temas como Una ventana al mundo, seleccionado como tema principal del disco, en el que, sobre una base de car\u00e1cter mas funky, Payo nos brinda una visi\u00f3n personal de los rudos contrastes sociales existentes entre clases. Despierto y pierdo, musicalmente m\u00e1s cercana al rock contempor\u00e1neo que al rap actual, nos muestra, en clave mas realista, las ilusiones de las que surgen nuestras decepciones a diario. Mi cartera es mi Biblia, una melod\u00eda \u00e1cida, para una rima brutalmente clara, sincera y descarnada en la que m\u00e1s de uno se ver\u00e1 reflejado. Para este trabajo, Shico Shanante utiliza pinceladas de estilos tan influyentes en la g\u00e9nesis del rap como el jazz, el funk, el soul o el r&b que, puestos a disposici\u00f3n de la l\u00edrica de PAYO MALO, tiene como resultado un disco que abrir\u00e1 mentes de dentro y fuera de la comunidad del rap.

Last's trademark was arranging pop hits in a big-band style; his series of \"party albums\" is equally well-known. Over the course of his career, he has sold well over 100 million albums.\n\nLast learned how to play piano as child, switching to bass as a teenager. He joined Hans-Gunther Oesterreich's Radio Bremen Dance Orchestra in 1946, when he was 17 years old. In 1948, he became the leader of the Becker-Last Ensemble, which performed for seven years. During that time, he was voted as the best bassist in the country by a German jazz poll for three consecutive years, from 1950-1952. After the disbandment of the Becker-Last Ensemble, he became the in-house arranger for Polydor Records, as well as for a number of European radio stations. For the next decade, he helped arrange hits for artists like Helmut Zacharias and Caterina Valente.\n\nLast released his first album \"Non-Stop Dancing\" in 1965. The record of brief renditions of popular songs, all tied together by an insistent dance beat and joyous crowd noises. It was a hit and helped make him a major European star. Over the next four decades, Last has released over 190 records, including several more volumes of Non-Stop Dancing. On these records, he varies his formula by adding different songs from different countries and genres, as well as guest performers like Richard Clayderman and Astrud Gilberto.\n\nThough his concerts and albums are consistently successful \u2014 especially in England, where he had 52 hit albums between 1967-1986, which made him second to Elvis Presley in terms of number of charting records \u2014 he has only had two hit singles with \"The Seduction,\" the theme from American Gigolo (1980) and Biscaya from the album \"Biscaya\".\n\nHe has won numerous polls and prizes, for example Billboard magazine's \"Star of the year\" trophy in 1976, and has been honored for his lifework with the German ECHO prize in 1994.\n\nThe song \"The Lonely Shepherd\", written by Last and performed by Gheorghe Zamfir and the James Last Orchestra, was featured in the soundtrack to Quentin Tarantino's film \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" (2003). \n\nPersonally, he divides his time between Florida and Germany. He gives much credit to his wife and son, who helps with the music. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/James+Last\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Born in Dallas, Texas, United States, and raised in Texas and South Florida, Van Winkle started his musical career in 1988 and released his debut album, 'Hooked', in 1989 through Ichiban Records. He soon signed a contract with SBK Records, which released a reformatted version of that album under the title 'To the Extreme'. Van Winkle's single \"Ice Ice Baby\" was the first hip-hop single to top the Billboard charts, and it has been credited with helping to diversify hip-hop by introducing it to a mainstream white audience.\n\nAlthough Van Winkle was successful, he later regretted his business arrangements with SBK, which had paid him to adopt a more commercial appearance and had published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. He strongly resented having to 'play along' with claims that he had survived violent underground gang fights while also wearing glamorized outfits. After surviving a suicide attempt by drug overdose when his mainstream fame evaporated, Van Winkle was inspired to change his musical style and lifestyle. Further albums by Van Winkle, including 'Hard to Swallow', 'Bi-Polar', and 'Platinum Underground', featured a less mainstream-oriented sound inspired by alternative metal. His latest album is 'Wisdom, Tenacity & Focus' (better known as just 'WTF'), which he released in 2011, which feature Ice's return to the more electronic and classic hip-hop sound that was present in some of his past classics.\n\nAs stated before, Van Winkle signed a contract with SBK Records in 1990, who reissued 'Hooked' under the title 'To the Extreme'. The reissue contained new artwork and music. According to Van Winkle, SBK paid him to adopt a more commercial, conventional appearance. Getting a break touring with MC Hammer, Van Winkle largely copied that artist's large stage shows, oversize pants, flamboyant hairstyles, and more. Van Winkle is quoted as saying that: {\"They told me, we want you to wear these baggy pants because the young kids like it and it's all glittery and polished and everything, and I said, 'Fuck no, I'm not wearin' this gay-ass shit.' And they said, 'Well here's a million dollars, man, will you do it?' And I said, 'Fuck yes.' And anybody would have done the same thing if they were given the same chance.\"}\n\nThe distribution of fabricated biographical information (such as that he was from Miami rather than Texas and that he had a long gang history) also helped quickly erode his street credibility. Though confident in his rhyming abilities and flow, Van Winkle soon regretted his business agreements with SBK and even expressed reservations when his fame grew. 'To the Extreme' became the fastest selling hip hop album of all time, peaking at #1 on the Billboard 200. The album spent 16 weeks on the charts, and it sold eleven million copies before long. For many years, it remained the best selling hip hop album of all time.\n\nSingle \"Ice Ice Baby\" has been credited for helping diversify rap music by introducing it to a mainstream, white audience. Still, critical reviews of 'To the Extreme' have been mixed. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Mim Udovitch gave the album a B, citing \"Ice Ice Baby\", \"Play That Funky Music\", \"Dancin'\" and \"It's a Party\" as the album's highlights. Robert Christgau gave the album a C\u2212 rating, writing that Van Winkle's \"suave sexism, fashionably male supremacist rather than dangerously obscene, is no worse than his suave beats\". \n\nCriticizing the technique and style shown, Allmusic reviewer Steve Huey wrote: {\"Ice's mic technique is actually stronger and more nimble than MC Hammer's, and he really tries earnestly to show off the skills he does have. Unfortunately, even if he can keep a mid-tempo pace, his flow is rhythmically stiff, and his voice has an odd timbre; plus, he never seems sure of the proper accent to adopt. He's able to overcome those flaws somewhat in isolated moments, but they become all too apparent over the course of an entire album.\"}\n\nFollowing the success of \"Ice Ice Baby\", California rapper Mario \"Chocolate\" Johnson, an associate of record producer Suge Knight, claimed that he had written and produced the song but had not received credit or royalties for the song. Van Winkle has often recounted the following story. Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, where Van Winkle was eating. After shoving Van Winkle's bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards sat down in front of Van Winkle, staring at him before finally asking \"How you doin'?\" Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions. Eventually, Knight showed up at Van Winkle's hotel suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by Johnson and a member of the Oakland Raiders. According to Van Winkle, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied that he would throw him off the balcony unless he signed the rights to the song over to Knight.\n\nVan Winkle has changed his accounting of said story over the years, which is still controversial years on. At any rate, by late 1990, Van Winkle began an eight-month relationship with Madonna, and appeared in photographs for her book 'Sex' while living a lavish lifestyle as a commercial superstar. While on tour in 1991, Van Winkle found out that SBK had instigated the publication of a book, 'Ice by Ice: The Vanilla Ice Story in His Own Words', written by Quon and attributed to Van Winkle, which detailed false biographical information, including claims that he had attended school with Luther Campbell. According to Van Winkle: {\"I was paid to have this label on it, 'authorized,' because there was like 6 or 7 books out before that says unauthorized right on the cover, meaning that it's bullshit right away. And so they paid me, I believe it was like $850,000 just to have that label and they printed the book. And it's full of shit. I read the book myself and I'm like, 'God, how could you fucking do that to me?'\"}\n\nAfter hiring investigators to find out who was involved in the book's publication, he found out that Quon and promoter Elaine Shock had been involved in publishing and promoting the fabricated biographical elements. Although he later greatly rejects being subject to such commercial exposure, Van Winkle found himself caught up in his 'sex, drugs, and rock n roll' lifestyle at the time. Buying motorcycles, mansions, and more, it was all a great change from his working-class upbringing.\n\nVan Winkle's second major release was the live album 'Extremely Live', released in March 1991. It peaked at #30 on the Billboard 200. Reviews of the album were particularly negative, with Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne calling it \"one of the most ridiculous albums ever released\" (comparing it to 'The Best of Marcel Marceau', an album which consisted of two sides of silence opened by brief applause'). According to Browne, 'Extremely Live' \"affords you the chance to hear inane stage patter and unaccompanied drumming, during which, one assumes, Ice and his posse are onstage dancing.\"\n\nVan Winkle branched out into the film industry, making an appearance in the film 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze' and performing the tune \"Ninja Rap\". Beginning to film his own personal project, 'Cool as Ice', in April 1991, he found himself soon embroiled in more controversy. On June 3, 1991, Van Winkle was arrested in Los Angeles on firearm charges, after threatening a homeless man, James N. Gregory, with a pistol. Gregory had approached Van Winkle's car outside of a supermarket and attempted to sell him a silver chain. Van Winkle and his bodyguard were charged with three weapons offenses. Van Winkle pleaded no contest.\n\n'Cool as Ice' opened on October 18, 1991 in 393 theaters in the United States, grossing $638,000, ranking at #14 among the week's new releases. However, it soon became a 'box office bomb' that severely weakened his career. Reviews of the film were widely negative. Film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 8%, and Van Winkle received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star.\n\nDuring this period, Van Winkle received criticism from other hip hop musicians. In 1991, 3rd Bass released a single called \"Pop Goes the Weasel\", comparing Van Winkle unfavorably to Elvis Presley. The song's music video featured Henry Rollins as Van Winkle, who is depicted as being assaulted by 3rd Bass. Del tha Funkee Homosapien referred to Van Winkle as mocking hip hop in the lyrics of \"Pissin' on Your Steps\", which appeared on his 1991 debut album (titled 'I Wish My Brother George Was Here').\n\nBy 1994, Van Winkle became isolated from the public spotlight, and had grown dreadlocks and began smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Van Winkle released his second studio album, Mind Blowin. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album \"more clunky than funky\". Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song \"Get Loose\" as \"snappy\", writing that although the lyrics are \"inane\", \"the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics.\" Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \"There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing.\" Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Van Winkle's cannabis-oriented lyrics: \"That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people.\"\n\nVan Winkle began using ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. During periods of heavy drug use, Van Winkle received many tattoos from artist acquaintances. According to Van Winkle, \"That was in my binge days. I didn't even realize how many I was getting\". Van Winkle attempted suicide with a heroin overdose. After being revived, Van Winkle decided that it was time to change his lifestyle. As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach.\n\nIn 1995, Van Winkle set up a recording studio in Miami, and joined a grunge band, Picking Scabs. Van Winkle expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound which he was looking for. In 1997, Van Winkle married Laura, whom he had met at a party. Van Winkle later developed a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, who had become known for producing music by Deftones, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sepultura. Robinson and Van Winkle shared an interest in motocross racing. According to Robinson, others had attempted to persuade him not to work with Van Winkle, feeling that it might hurt his reputation. Encouraged by this fear, Robinson agreed to work with Van Winkle. In an interview, Robinson stated \"It's the most punk-rock thing you could do.\"\n\nVan Winkle's third studio album, Hard to Swallow, featured a darker sound and lyrics than Van Winkle's previous work. Reviews of the album were generally negative. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that \"If history is any guide, Vanilla Ice's adoption of rap-metal means that hard rock is about to move on.\" Richard Torres of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, writing that while \"nothing, however, can redeem Ice's wack boasting,\" the album \"isn't half-bad.\" In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Kemp gave the album three out of five stars, writing that it contained Van Winkle's \"most convincing music\". In 1999, the music video for \"Ice Ice Baby\" was \"retired\" on the MTV special 25 Lame, in which Van Winkle himself appeared to destroy the video's master tape. When Van Winkle was given a baseball bat, he ended up destroying the show's set.\nIndependent releases (2000 onward)\nVanilla Ice appearing at the Tex-Mex Grill in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nHaving attracted a following outside of his former mainstream audience, Van Winkle began recording independently. In May 2000, Van Winkle made an appearance at a wrestling match promoted by Juggalo Championship Wrestling, then known as Juggalo Championshit Wrestling, filling in for Insane Clown Posse member Joseph Utsler, who had been injured during a match. It was reported that Insane Clown Posse would make an appearance on Van Winkle's next album, tentatively titled Bomb Tha System. In October 2000, it was announced that Van Winkle's next album would be titled Skabz, and that Chuck D was confirmed to appear on the album. It was initially planned as a double album featuring a disc containing rock-oriented material and a disc of hip hop songs.\n\nIn January 2001, Van Winkle was arrested by police in Davie, Florida for assaulting Laura. According to the criminal complaint, Van Winkle and his wife argued as they drove on Interstate 595. Van Winkle admitted to pulling hair from her head to prevent her from jumping out of the truck's window. He pleaded guilty to charges of disorderly conduct four months later, and was sentenced to probation and ordered to attend family therapy sessions. In July 2001, Van Winkle performed at the second Gathering of the Juggalos. On October 23, 2001, Skabz and Bomb Tha System were released as a single album, Bi-Polar. Bradley Torreano of Allmusic disliked the album, criticizing it as \"wildly uneven and at times hilariously bad\". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Kemp gave the album one out of five stars, calling the album \"utterly listless\".\n\nFrom January to February 2004, Van Winkle appeared on the reality television series The Surreal Life. In November 2004, Van Winkle's pet wallaroo, Bucky, and pet goat, Pancho, escaped from his Port St. Lucie, Florida home. After wandering around local streets for over a week, the animals were caught and returned to Van Winkle. He had to pay a $220 fine for expired pet tags and an undisclosed fine for the escape of the animals. On August 2, 2005, Van Winkle released his fifth studio album, Platinum Underground. Van Winkle stated that the title of the album reflected the fact that he could maintain a fanbase without mainstream airplay. Allmusic reviewer Rob Theakston panned the album, writing that it \"has more bad spots in it than most\".\n\nOn April 10, 2008, Van Winkle was arrested in Palm Beach County on a battery charge for allegedly kicking and hitting Laura. He was released the following day after she declared that her husband had only pushed her. In court, the couple's neighbor, Frank Morales, stated that it was merely a verbal argument. Van Winkle was ordered by a Florida court to stay away from his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him. The judge told Van Winkle that he could only contact his wife via telephone. On April 29, 2008, Van Winkle's lawyers, Bradford Cohen and Joseph LoRusso, were able to get the case dropped after providing the state attorney with evidence that conflicted with what was originally reported.\n\nVan Winkle began following a vegetarian diet. In September 2008, Van Winkle signed a contract with Cleopatra Records, recording the cover album Vanilla Ice Is Back! at the label's request. The album was released on November 4, 2008, and contained covers of songs by Public Enemy, House of Pain, Bob Marley and Cypress Hill. IGN reviewer Spence D. called the album \"an embarrassing endeavor that sounds like it should have stayed locked inside Ice's studio (or at the very least leaked on YouTube and passed off as a piss take).\" On February 27, 2009, Van Winkle performed as part of a joint performance with MC Hammer in Orem, Utah. In March 2009, Van Winkle participated in a Virgin Mobile advertising campaign titled \"Right Music Wrongs\", apologizing for his 1990s image. As part of the campaign, Van Winkle was placed on \"trial\", and was voted innocent by users of the campaign website. In August 2009, Van Winkle announced on his official Twitter account that he had signed a contract with StandBy Records, who will release his sixth studio album, Yesterday Is History, Tomorrow Is A Mystery.\n Style and influences\nVan Winkle performing in Massachusetts on February 16, 2007\n\nVan Winkle's current live performances feature a mix of newer, rock-influenced material and old school hip hop. Van Winkle performs with a live drummer and DJ, and sometimes sprays his audience with bottled water. Describing his performances, Van Winkle stated \"It's high energy, stage diving, pyrotechnics, girls showing their breasts. It's crazy party atmosphere.\" In promotion of Hard to Swallow, Van Winkle toured with a seven-piece live band which included bassist Scott Shriner. The band opened with rock-oriented material from Hard to Swallow and concluded with older hip hop songs.\n\nVan Winkle stated that his musical style was influenced by underground music, rather than mainstream music, and that his influences included hip hop and funk artists such as Funkadelic, Rick James and Parliament. Van Winkle also stated that he enjoys Rage Against the Machine, Slipknot and System of a Down. Van Winkle sometimes plays bass, drums and keyboards on studio recordings. Rapper G-Child, best known for her appearance on ego trip's The (White) Rapper Show, has credited Van Winkle as being a major influence on her work. After meeting Van Winkle in 2000, G-Child performed freestyle raps at six of Van Winkle's performances, and opened for him four times.\n\n\nBand members\n\nCurrent\n\n    * DJ Dirty Chopstix \u2014 turntables and background vocals\n    * Keith Reber \u2014 drums\n    * DJ DP - turntables and background vocals\n\nFormer\n\n    * D-Shay \u2014 disc jockey\n    * Clint Barlow - drums\n    * Earthquake \u2014 disc jockey\n    * Rod J \u2014 disc jockey\n    * Zero \u2014 disc jockey\n    * Scott Shriner \u2014 bass\n\nDiscography\nMain article: Vanilla Ice discography\n\n    * To the Extreme (1990)\n    * Extremely Live (1991)\n    * Mind Blowin (1994)\n    * Hard to Swallow (1998)\n    * Bi-Polar (2001)\n    * Platinum Underground (2005)\n    * Yesterday Is History, Tomorrow Is A Mystery (2009)\n* WTF (2011) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Vanilla+Ice\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The group has released 5 albums to date: Tavo Sielos Vagiz, Betono Sakm\u0117s, Gatves Lyga, Alchemija and  I\u0161vien. G&G Sindikatas consists of 5 members - 3 MCs: Svaras, Kastetas, Pushaz, producer Donciavas and a DJ - DJ Mamania. \n\nG&G Sindikatas have been a part of the Lithuanian hip-hop scene for 11 years already. In the very beginning, the band consisted of 2 MC's (Svaras & Giga) laying rhymes down on the music produced by Exem, the well-known Lithuanian electronic music project. The band gave occasional live and radio performances. A collaboration track with the punk band \"Turboreanimacija\" even managed to reach No. 1 in the charts of a then-popular independent radio station.\n\nIn 1997, the high tide of hip-hop was gone in Lithuania. MC Giga left the band to pursue a career in a different field, while Svaras continued working on new tracks. In 1998, he met producer Donciavas who was working in a small independent recording studio called Porno Sound and eventually started producing new instrumentals for Svaras. Kastetas, a former punk rock drummer who was working on his hip-hop project Afro in the same studio, later appeared on several tracks by Svaras. Guest appearances were also made by MC Pushaz, then member of the well-known hip-hop band Zenitas.\n\nSvaras was in search of a DJ to provide scratching tricks during live performances. Soon he got to know DJ Mamania, who from that point on became permanently associated with the group. It wasn\u2019t long before the first official full-length by G&G Sindikatas was ready for release. Titled \u201cTavo sielos vagiz\u201d (Your Soul\u2019s Thief), it was released by the independent label Guru Records and appeared in the stores right before Christmas 1999. The 500 units that were made sold out quickly. \n\nOne and a half year later, G&G was signed by Bomba, a Lithuanian major label. In June 2001, \"Gatves lyga\" (The Street League), the group\u2019s second album, was released. It took a mere month before it went gold, selling 10 000 copies. At that point, MC Pushaz joined the forces and started performing together with G&G. In one year, G&G Sindikatas became a five-piece band.\n\nIn the same year, G&G won the Best Debut nominations in two Lithuanian music awards (Radiocentras and Bravo). Right after that came their third album, \"Betono Sakm\u0117s\" (Stories of Concrete), taking less than a month to go gold. In October 2002, G&G started its first Lithuanian tour, giving 20 concerts in various cities and towns.\n\n2002 was the year when G&G Sindikatas started participating in more diverse and genre-crossing collaborations. Famous Lithuanian composer Linas Rim\u0161a invited G&G to take part in two of his projects: Opera in da House and Guerilla Jazz.lt, in which famous Lithuanian jazz musicians took part as well. The imaginative fusion of jazz and hip-hop led the Guerilla Jazz.lt project to be included in the line-up of the international jazz festival Kaunas Jazz 2003. \n\nG&G Sindikatas\u2019 long-time dream came true in 2003 as well: the band finally performed abroad.

Known as a talented freestyle rapper, Skillz has not received widespread acclaim outside of the hip-hop community, but within it is considered one of its best performers.\n\nHe first made a name for himself by finishing in second place in a national freestyle competition in 1992, which resulted in a recording contract with Atlantic Records. Skillz' Atlantic debut, From Where???, and its single, \"The Nod Factor\", were released in 1996, but sank without a trace. In the late-1990s, he allied himself with fellow Virginia natives Missy Elliott, Timbaland, and The Neptunes. He made appearances on Timbaland's albums Tim's Bio in 1998, and Indecent Proposal in 2001; Timbaland made plans to sign Skillz to the Blackhand label he was developing, the label failed to materialize. He along with Danja Mowf, Lonnie B, and Patrice O'Neal, members of Mad Skillz' Supafriendz collective, also appeared on a remix of Aaliyah's hit single \"Are You That Somebody\" in 1998.\n\nMore recently (2000) Skillz is known for his tell all single \"Ghostwriter\". In which he names (but edits) artists for which he has written hit singles. With lines like 'I'm a ghostwriter, I'm the cat that you don't see\/I write hits for rappers you like and charge 'em a fee'. Un-edited versions of the track have not surfaced but Skillz is known to do a live performance in which he includes the names. In one live performance he mentions P. Diddy, Foxy Brown, Mase, and Jermaine Dupri. One artist who openly admits Skillz has written hits for him is P. Diddy.\nFrom 2002 through 2006 Skillz has done a year end \"Rap-Up\" song that encapsulates the events of the prior 12 months.\n\nSkillz eventually got a deal with Rawkus, where he recorded his 2002 LP I Ain't Mad No More, the title of which commemorated the official change of his MC moniker from \"Mad Skillz\" to just \"Skillz\". The afore mentioned LP was never officially released in the U.S., however, during the Sprite Liquid Mix Tour in 2003 he sold some bootleg versions of this CD. The CD was re-packaged without several tracks as \"Confessions Of A Ghostwriter\" in 2005. A Supafriends LP, Supavision, and another solo LP. A client for the Mama's Boys management company which also includes Musiq, Skillz has been a featured artist at okayplayer.com, run by ?uestlove of The Roots.

He would continually mock who would be his main producer, Jermaine Dupri, who produced a majority of his first album, Hood Hop. Regardless, according to Dupri, J-Kwon was also signed because of his rapping skills.\n\nJ-Kwon first rose to stardom with his single \"Tipsy\" and his 2004 album Hood hop. J-Kwon's debut peaked at #7 on the Billboard 200. It has reached gold status, selling approximentaly 650,000 copies to date. \"Tipsy\" peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at #4 in the UK, becoming a success and making it his biggest single to date. A music video was filmed for the single, which was an obvious remake of Gin & Juice by Snoop Dogg. Strangely on the set of this music video, a shot was fired from a passing vehicle. The shot hit a window of a van, but no one was hurt.\n\nAfter \"Tipsy\" has done its fair share on the radio, Jive parted with \"You & Me\", featuring Sadiyyah, as the second single. J-Kwon wanted \"Parking Lot\" or \"Hood Hop\" to be a second single, but Jive decided \"You & Me\" with the fall and holiday theme in mind. While nowhere near as successful as the earlier smash, the song did chart to #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and landed a spot on the 17th edition of Now That's What I Call Music! Afterwards, third single \"Hood Hop\" had little success, not charting on The Hot 100 and only getting to #52 on Billboard R&B\/Hip-Hop Tracks.\n\nJ-Kwon rose back to stardom in 2005 when he was given the opportunity to make the priority song on the XXX: State of the Union soundtrack. The song, \"Get XXX'd\", featuring Petey Pablo and Ebony Eyez, was completed soon enough and was featured on the normal soundtrack and in the credits.

He is the highest selling Southern hip hop solo artist of all time with over 15 million units sold in the United States and around 20 million records sold worldwide. He released his debut album Incognegro in 1999 and has since released a further seven albums. His ninth studio album, Ludaversal, will be released sometime in 2012.\n\nEarly years\n\nBridges began his music career as a radio personality and DJ as Chris Lova Lova on Hot 97, an urban radio station in Atlanta, Georgia. He made his recorded debut on \"Phat Rabbit,\" a track from Timbaland's 1998 album Tim's Bio: Life from the Basement. Although both Timbaland and Jermaine Dupri showed interest in signing Ludacris, he decided to release the album \"Incognegro\" independently in 1999. The album sold over 50,000 copies through the Atlanta based independent music distributor, Southern Music Distribution. The same year, he recorded the theme to the video game Madden NFL 2000. Scarface, an original member of the Geto Boys, signed Ludacris in 2000 to Def Jam Recordings, and created a new imprint, Def Jam South, around him.\n\nBack for the First Time\n\nLudacris released his major label debut, Back for the First Time, in October 2000. The album reached as high as #4 on the charts, and was a major success. Ludacris made his mark on the industry with singles such as \"Southern Hospitality\" and \"What's Your Fantasy\", along with his first ever single \"Phat Rabbit\", from 2 years prior. Back for the First Time was the beginning of Ludacris's explosion to the top of the rap world.\n\nWord of Mouf\n\nLudacris promptly completed his next album, Word Of Mouf and released it at the end of 2001. Its lead single, \"Rollout (My Business)\" was boycotted in many American video stations. Despite the controversy, the video was nominated for a 2003 VMA, and Luda performed it live at the awards' pre-show. Ludacris also toured with Papa Roach in 2002 after the release of their sophomore album lovehatetragedy. Ludacris reached a new level of notoriety when TV's Bill O'Reilly expressed outrage that Pepsi had hired Ludacris as a spokesman. O'Reilly repeatedly attacked Ludacris's foul language and called for a nation-wide boycott of Pepsi, who then fired Ludacris and hired Ozzy Osbourne's family instead.\n\nChicken-N-Beer\n\nDuring the spring of 2003, Ludacris returned to the music scene after a brief hiatus with a new single, \"Act A Fool\" from the 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack. At around the same time, he released the lead single from his upcoming album, Chicken & Beer, called \"P-Poppin\" (short for \"Pussy Poppin'\"). Neither of his new singles were as well-received by either the urban or pop audiences as his previous songs had been, and both music videos received only limited airplay. Chicken & Beer opened strongly, but without a popular single, the album fell quickly.\n\nHowever, in the fall of 2003, Ludacris rebounded with his next single, \"Stand Up\", which appeared on both Chicken & Beer as well as the soundtrack for the teen hip-hop\/dance movie, Honey. Produced by Kanye West, \"Stand Up\" went on to become Ludacris' biggest mainstream hit to date, hitting the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and garnering heavy airplay on mainstream pop, rhythmic, and urban radio stations, as well as on MTV, MTV2, and BET.\n\nThe album's next single, \"Splash Waterfalls\", was released in early 2004. Though not a pop hit, it became a success at urban radio and BET. It was Ludacris' most sexual video yet and an R&B remix that featured Raphael Saadiq and sampled Tony! Toni! Tone!'s \"Whatever You Want\". Luda next released \"Blow It Out\", a gritty song that had a heavily low-budget, gritty, and urban-looking music video, which was a huge departure from the colorful, sensual, R&B leanings depicted in \"Splash Waterfalls\". \"Blow It Out\" acted both as a scathing response to the aforementioned criticism levied by Bill O'Reilly and an expression of disgust at Pepsi's cowardice in the affair:\n\n    Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'm'a throw you a curve\n    You mad cause I'm a thief and got away with words\n    I'm'a start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves\n    Pepsi's the New Generation?\u2014Blow it out cha ass!\n\n    * On 1 June 2006, a federal jury found that \"Stand Up\" did not infringe on the copyright of a song called \"Straight Like That\" by a New Jersey group known as I.O.F. \"I hope the plaintiffs enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame,\" Ludacris said after the verdict. \"This whole experience is proof to me of why I will always fight for what I believe in.\"\n\nThe Red Light District\n\nThe fourth studio album from Ludacris. Although entirely different from the usual antics of the previous albums, Ludacris had taken a more mature approach to his album. Ludacris openly boasted that he may be the only rapper able to keep the Def Jam label afloat. Ludacris had recently filmed and recorded the single \"Get Back\" in which he was featured a muscle-bounded hulk who was being annoyed by the media and warned his critics to leave him alone. He also was featured on Saturday Night Live playing his song Get Back with Sum 41. The follow-up single was the Austin Powers-inspired \"The Number One Spot\". It was produced by New York City's Hot 97 personality DJ Green Lantern. It used the Quincy Jones sample of \"Soul Bossa Nova\" and sped it up to the tempo of Ludacris' rap flow. Ludacris also filmed the video in which he pokes fun at O'Reilly's problems with Andrea Mackris (Hi Mr. O'Reilly \/ Hope all is well kiss the plaintiff and the wifey). Production credits come also from veteran producers Timbaland, Lil' Jon, The Medicine Men and legendary rapper Doug E. Fresh. Featured artists on the album include Nas, DJ Quik, DMX, Trick Daddy, and Disturbing Tha Peace newcomers Bobby Valentino (of Mista fame) and Dolla Boi and Small World. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts. And most recently the rapper had used his opportunity to start his own foundation. The Ludacris Foundation started by Ludacris and Chaka Zulu is an organization that helps young middle and high school students motivate themselves in creative arts. Ludacris also has a daughter by the name of Karma. Ludacris had also participated at the Super Bowl and is the spokesman for the Boost Mobile Phone ad-campaign. Ludacris also received his first Grammy Award with Usher and Lil Jon for their hit single \"Yeah\"\n\nRelease Therapy\n\nIn a recent issue of XXL, a hip-hop based magazine, Ludacris was placed in the number nine spot for the most anticipated albums of 2006, for Release Therapy. The album Release Therapy was released on September 26, 2006. Ludacris is going to format the cd to have two sides, a Release side and a Therapy side. With the Release side having songs that allow him to get everything off his chest and the Therapy side being just feel-good music. A song titled \"War With God\" is one of the confirmed tracks from the upcoming album. The first single, \"Money Maker\", which features Pharrell, was released to U.S. radio outlets on July 17. Others songs will be : \"Tell It Like It Is\" (Produced by Elaborate Musik Workshop), \"Runaway Love\" (Feat. Mary J. Blige) and Woozy (Feat. R. Kelly)[1] \"Money Maker\" reached number one on the BET 106 & Park Countdown for the first time on September 15, 2006. The album recently reached number 1 on the Billboard 200 album charts with sales of more than 300,000 in its first week.\n\nTo promote the album, Ludacris will be hosting and performing on Saturday Night Live 18 November. Ludacris is the second and only rapper to host and perform on the same episode (MC Hammer hosted and performed in 1991, on different episodes ).\n\nTheater of the Mind\n\nLudacris's 6th album, Theater of the Mind was released on November 24, 2008 it includes the singles \"What them Girls Like\" Co-Starring Chris Brown and Sean Garrett , \"One More Drink\" Co-Starring T-Pain, and \"Nasty Girl\" Co-Starring Piles. The New album peaked at 1 on U.S. Billboard Top Rap Albums and peaked at 5 on U.S. Billboard 200. \n\nActing career\n\nLudacris has been acting in film since The Wash in 2001, but his big break came in 2005, where he received critical praise for his roles in the Oscar-winning films Hustle & Flow and Crash. Crash includes an ironic sequence where Ludacris's character is dismissive of hip-hop music. Interestingly, in both films, he is physically beaten by characters played by Terrence Howard. He is occasionally credited as \"Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges\".\n\nOn January 29, 2006 he was awarded with a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture for his work in the film Crash. Ludacris also starred in 2 Fast 2 Furious.Ludacris narrated the 2006 Ward Serrill basketball documentary \"Heart of the Game.\" Ludacris recently cut his trademark braids off to project a new image for his upcoming album, Release Therapy.\n\nHe recently appeared in the 28 March 2006 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Ludacris portrayed Darius Randall, the nephew of Detective Fin Tutuola, portrayed by Ice T.\n\nDisputes\n\nFurthering the controversy, in response to the signing of the Osbourne family, popular music hip-hop mogul, Russell Simmons, organized a boycott against the company. Simmons demanded an apology from Pepsi to Ludacris and a 5 million dollar donation to one of Ludacris' charities. Eventually Simmons and Pepsi settled on an agreement to stop the boycott, right before it was to officially begin-- while Pepsi did not formally apologize to Ludacris, they did agree to donate millions of dollars over years to Russel Simmon Hip-Hop Summit Action Network.\n\nLudacris' song \"Blow It Out\" (from the Chicken & Beer album), acted as a scathing response to his critics, namely O'Reilly.\n\nIn another song, \"Hoes in My Room\", he tells a story about anonymous prostitutes being left in his room, and at the end of the last verse he says:\n\nThen it got to my head and Somethin' remind me\n\nI know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly.\n\nThen, in 2004, in \"Number 1 Spot\"\n\nRespected highly, Hi Mr. O'Reilly.\n\nHope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with GQ magazine, Ludacris criticized Oprah Winfrey about his appearance on her show with the cast of the film Crash. During the interview, the conversation veered from the movie and Winfrey chose to speak on Ludacris' lyrical content, which he felt was unfair as he was visiting her show in the capacity of an actor and not a rapper. Also, Ludacris was upset that some of his responses were later edited from the show's airing. He was later joined by other rappers such as 50 Cent, Ice Cube and Killer Mike who argued that Winfrey had an anti-hip hop bias.\n\nWinfrey responded by saying that she's opposed to rap lyrics that \"marginalize women,\" but enjoys some artists, including Kanye West, who appeared on her show. She said she spoke with Ludacris backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of his listeners might take it literally. Ludacris later said the media had blown his comments out of proportion and said he respects Winfrey and considers her \"a great individual.\"\n\nIn 2004, before the release of his debut album Straight Outta Ca$hville, Nashville, Tennessee native and G-Unit member Young Buck would enlist the services of fellow Atlanta emcee T.I., also known as T.I.P. in his native Bankhead neighborhood of westside Atlanta. They would create a track entitled \"Stomp\" amid growing tension between Buck's good friend Ludacris and T.I. On the track, T.I. takes subliminal shots at Ludacris including the line \"me gettin' beat down, that's ludicrous.\" Buck, immediately sensing the tension, decided before releasing the track to notify Ludacris that T.I. had mentioned him since he didn't want to position himself as encouraging T.I.'s actions. Ludacris hears the track and asks Buck if he can add his own verse to which Buck agrees. The results end up being costly for T.I. as he is berated throughout Ludacris' verse and called out by name in his last line. Representatives from T.I. notify Buck that T.I.'s vocals will not be cleared for the album unless T.I. is allowed to change his verse, and also have Ludacris change his. Buck refuses this offer and T.I. prohibits his vocals from being used. Buck has hypeman and fellow rapper D-Tay replace T.I. on the song and D-Tay himself is eventually replaced by The Game on the official release.\n\nAlthough T.I. was removed, the street cut featuring him and Ludacris had already been leaked to DJs in Atlanta and New York. T.I. was unable to stop the track's distribution throughout the streets of the nation at this point. It is widely accepted that T.I. \"lost\" this battle with Ludacris easily being the victor. The beef between Ludacris and T.I. was then put to an end behind closed doors as T.I. said that the problems between them have ceased.\n\nIn 2006 however, T.I. would release his highly anticipated fourth solo album entitled KING. In his Just Blaze produced track titled \"I'm Talkin To You,\" T.I. lyrically attacks one or more unknown targets who have widely been speculated to be either Ludacris, New Orleans emcee Lil Wayne, or Houston rapper Lil' Flip (whom T.I. also had beef with but has since ended their animosity behind closed doors) or a combination of all three. It is still unknown whether or not T.I. was in fact battling Ludacris again or anyone else for that matter at all. A closer listen to the song, however proves that T.I. isnt dissing Ludacris. In one of T.I.s lines he quotes \"had it out with 'Cris, but he still my nigga...sat down civilized talked about it like niggas\", alluding to the sit down that he and Ludacris had to end their beef. As a matter of fact during the taping of MTV's My Block 'Atlanta', T.I. and Ludacris are shown greeting each other respectfully.\n\nIn July of 2006, a track entitled \"War with God\" would see Ludacris return after some time off in movies. In the track, Ludacris goes on the offensive against an unknown rapper who has sold drugs, and makes repeated references to shooting guns in his songs, isn't as rich as he (Ludacris) and likes to give himself titles - all very well known characteristics and facts directly relating to T.I and Young Jeezy (or countless other less popular rappers) or the newcoming rappers Yung Joc and Young Dro. In this instance it also unknown whether or not Ludacris is indeed aiming his disses at Young Jeezy, T.I. or if the track is even a song recorded recently. Ludacris recently stated that the song was deeper than just a diss, and the song is more about him than anyone else, it's showing that he isn't just the 'cartoon entertainer' type rapper that he has always been portrayed as, when asked about who specific rhymes were aimed at he said \"The guilty will speak\". The track has been confirmed to be a selection from Ludacris' upcoming album Release Therapy this September. The song is not aimed at Young Jeezy as he features on the latest album. \"War with God\" uses a beat written by Don Cheegro and Dirty Harry. Hardship took over ludacris and he was under alot of stress by the end of that album.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ludacris\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Her debut album, Funkdafied, sold one million copies making her the first female rapper to have a platinum-selling album.Regarding her soon-to-be rap name, Harris told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that she got the name because she is \"a spoiled only child.\" Harris is the half-sister of actress LisaRaye McCoy\n\nIn 1992, Harris got a big break when she won the grand prize in a local rap contest sponsored by Yo! MTV Raps. For the prize, she got to meet Kris Kross, and they in turn introduced her to their producer, Jermaine Dupri, who signed her to his So So Def label. Dupri cultivated Da Brat's image as a \"female Snoop Doggy Dogg\", and she became one of the first female \"reality-based\" rappers.\n\nDa Brat's debut album Funkdafied was released in 1994 and entered the rap albums chart at Number #1. The album went platinum, which made her the first female solo rapper to sell one million units. The single also entitled \"Funkdafied\" reached #1 on the rap singles chart and #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. She had a follow-up hit from the same album, \"Give It 2 You\", which reached #26 on the Hot 100.\n\nIn 1996, Da Brat released her second full-length album, Anuthatantrum, which included the single \"Ghetto Love\" featuring T-Boz of TLC.\n\nDuring the rest of the '90s, Da Brat came to be known more for her \"featured\" appearances on other rappers' and R&B singers' albums rather than for her own solo work. She contributed a rhyme to the hip hop remix of Mariah Carey's hit, \"Always Be My Baby\". She also made her feature film debut that year in Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal. During the summer of 1997, Da Brat appeared along with Dupri on a remix of Carey's \"Honey (So So Def mix)\" and recorded the hit remix of \"Ladies' Night (Not Tonight)\" with Lil' Kim, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, Angie Martinez and Missy Elliott.

That year, she was also featured on a remix of the Destiny's Child single \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\".\n\nIn early 2000, Da Brat released her third full-length album Unrestricted, which produced the moderately successful singles \"That's What I'm Looking For\" (U.S. #56) and \"What Chu Like\" (U.S. #26), featuring soul singer, Tyrese. The album was not well received compared to Brat's earlier work. However, the new album and new millennium did inspire an image makeover for Da Brat. Abandoning her \"gangsta\" persona, she decided to follow the trend in popular music and attempted to add to her sex appeal; the video for \"What Chu Like\" featured Da Brat and Tyrese rolling around naked on a beach.\n\nIn 2001, Brat continued her trend of being featured on other artist's remixes, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot R&B\/Hip Hop Singles chart along with rapper Ludacris on the main remix of Mariah Carey's \"Loverboy\" and being featured artist on Destiny's Child's \"Survivor\" remix. Da Brat also appeared as Louise in Carey's 2001 movie Glitter. In 2003, Brat released her fourth album, titled Limelite, Luv & Niteclubz, and appeared on the 4th season of VH1's The Surreal Life.\n\nIn 2001, Da Brat pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct after she had beaten a woman with a gun during a dispute over VIP seating in a Buckhead, Georgia, nightclub in 2000. The victim in that incident received six stitches for a head wound. Harris ended up serving a year's probation, performed 80 hours of community service and paid a $1,000 fine.\n\nIn 2005, she made a comeback of sorts when she was featured on the remix to the song \"I Think They Like Me,\" by Dem Franchize Boyz, which also featured Bow Wow and Jermaine Dupri. The song peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot R&B\/Hip Hop Singles chart and #15 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn 2006, she was an onstage guest on Mariah Carey's The Adventures of Mimi Tour in Atlanta, New York City, Long Island, Washington DC, Chicago, and Los Angeles performing her rap verses on the \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Honey\" remixes. She was also featured on Kelly Rowland's \"Gotsta Go\", a bonus track from her 2007 album Ms. Kelly and is also featured on a bonus track from Carey's E=MC\u00b2 on a track entitled \"4real4real\". She also co-wrote a song with Mariah Carey called \"O.O.C.\" which appears on E=MC\u00b2 and contributes backing vocals on the track.In 2007, she participated in the fifth season of the VH1 reality series Celebrity Fit Club.\n\nOn October 31, 2007, she was involved in the altercation that ended in assault at a Halloween party at Studio 72 nightclub in Tucker, Georgia. Harris sparred verbally with a hostess, and later, when the hostess proceeded to talk to her manager, Harris attacked her from behind, striking her in the face with a rum bottle.

The general public were first introduced to Obie on D12's Devil's Night album on a skit. His one-line opener (\"Obie Trice: Real name, no gimmicks\" - taken from his song \"Rap Name\" and referring to the lack of a rap pseudonym) on Eminem's lead single; \"Without Me\", off the critically-acclaimed and commercially successful The Eminem Show increased public awareness of his name and slogan.

Born in Hong Kong in 1971, he started DJing at the age of 15, getting into hip-hop music because the beats were fun to play with and they allowed him to work on his mixing skills. By 1991, at the age of 19, he was crowned the Hong Kong DMC DJ Champion. He won that title again the next year, and went on to compete in the Technics World DJ Championship at the Ministry of Sound in London, where he came No.8 in the world. He was the Hong Kong DMC DJ Champion again in 1996, which took him to the Technics World DJ Championship in Italy Rimini. Tommy did what was then thought inconceivable for a little-known DJ from Hong Kong: He became the No.2 scratchmaster in the world. Since then, Tommy has played at gigs all around the world, including Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore and Korea. Even in 1998, he was flown to Moscow to DJ at The Olympic Youth Games. He has been booked to play alongside great international spinners and acts like DJ Shadow, DJ Krush, DJ Food and the Prodigy.\n\nDJ Tommy is also a renowned producer, working with local artists like Jan Lamb. He was specially asked to remix the \"Sing It Back\" track for the UK alternative group, Moloko, as a bonus song for their CD's Hong Kong release. This marked the first time a local DJ released a re-mixed song for an international act. And as if all his world-first achievements weren't enough, DJ Tommy is also the mixmaster for Hong Kong's only hip-hop outfit, LMF. Besides recording and performing with this 12-member group. In 2002, DJ Tommy discovered the group, FAMA and FAMA joined Color Music Entertainment Ltd. (Founded by DJ Tommy). FAMA released their first EP \u201cCheng Wing Chi\u201d in 2005 and \u201cMusic Tycoon\u201d in 2006 which comes out a conspicuous success. After that, DJ Tommy recommended FAMA to sign a record deal with CMD (Founded by DJ Tommy & Edison Chen) and releasing the big hit CD Album \u201cFeng Sheng Shui Qi\u201d in 2007.\n\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/DJ+Tommy\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The members are Prince Paul, Wise, DBC (the Devastating Beat Creator), Daddy-O, Delite, Bobby Simmons, and Fruitkwan aka Frukwan.\nOriginally, the group was known as the Stetson Brothers, but they changed their name to Stetsasonic for their debut, On Fire, due to their preference of Stetson hats. The album received mixed reviews, though the follow-ups, In Full Gear and Blood, Sweat & No Tears were critically acclaimed.\n\nThe group broke up soon after the release of Blood, Sweat & No Tears. Frukwan and Prince Paul worked with the Gravediggaz, while the latter also became a well-respected record producer, as did Daddy O, who worked for Mary J.

The founding members of the band are Kriszti\u00e1n Szucs and Robert N\u00e9meth, who were college classmates in the city of Esztergom. Soon Gyula Orb\u00e1n and Endre Kiss joined the band as well (both former members of the Paks based band Houdinis). During this summer, sound engineer Bernhard Hahn from Stuttgart offered a helping hand to the band, and together they worked together on HS7's debut album Tick Tock No Fear. The album was made independently, and released privately, as the band did not yet have a recording deal. Around this time the band starts to play their first \"serious\" gigs. The band is born!\n\nIn the fall of 1995 another former member of Houdinis, G\u00e1bor Balczer, joins HS7, bring the band to a total of 5 members. Still without a record deal, the band starts work in the summer of 1996 on the album titled \"Goal\". During the Fall, Endre Kiss decides to leave the band.\n\nAfter a long and exhausting search for a record deal, the band struck a deal with the newly formed Warner Music Hungary label, a division of 1G Records, in 1997. Soon the album \"Goal\" is released, and becomes available in several retail outlets. The band also produces their first serious video clip for the track \"Wallflower\". This clip eventually is played not only in Hungary, but on some MTV Europe programs as well, a big achievement for the band.\n\n1998\nThere is a fresh batch of songs put together. The Budapest Dolls is put together in studios in Stuttgart, Germany, where they were already \"regulars\" in Bernhard's studios. There were also contributions from Quimby band member Szilard Balanyi.(special guest star on the album). A serious turning point occurs in the life of the band, as the first Hungarian language songs are prepared. Two of these songs \"Hiphop mjuzik\" and \"Valami\" become minor hits in the Hungarian music charts. In Fall 1998, after much searching, the band adds new member Zoltan \"Japan\" Takacs to play keyboards, who in addition to being a very talented keyboardist, also has the uncanny ability to speak Japanese, hence the nickname.\n\n1999\nMainly a low key year for the band, though HS7 do begin work on some new tracks with an eye towards releasing a new album. The band does score a very memorable gig, as they play the Budapest Kisstadion in support of the very popular REM. Guitarist Peter Buck was sufficiently impressed with the band that he asked the band for a copy of their album. He received it right away. Mike Mills then wanted a copy as well, but due to lack of supplies, Mills did not get his HS7 CD.\n\n2000\nSpring 2000, HS7 completes their first fully Hungarian language album \"Cukor\". With the production support of Neo duo, this becomes their breakthrough album, including hit songs such as the \"straight from the heart\" song \"Hol van az a kr\u00e9zi sr\u00e1c\", the dance song \"Mozdulj\", and the rocker \"Sajn\u00e1lom\". \"Hol van az a kr\u00e9zi sr\u00e1c\" becomes a number one hit on the Hungarian charts in the month \"Cukor\" is released. No so-called \"alternative\" band in Hungary has achieved this since.. This was the moment that their music became far more known within Hungary, and band enjoyed much broader recognition, including successful concert tours and festival performances The bands EP \"White Lies in Hi-Fi\", containing four songs, is picked by England based publication \"Record Collector\" as \"EP of the month\".\n\n2002\nThe band prepares their longest, most complex, and diverse album titled \"Kisfilmek a nagyvil\u00e1gb\u00f3l\". On this album you can find memorable song such as the bittersweet \"\u00c9jszaka\", the playful hit \"D\u00e9l-Amerika\" (for which the well-known Hungarian artist, Bal\u00e1zs Gr\u00f3f prepared a cartoon video clip for), and the jubilant \"Ezut\u00e1n\", as well as the epic \"A r\u00e9gi n\u00f3ta\".\n\n2003\nHS7 plays the main stage of the Sziget festival (one of the largest music festivals in Europe), supporting international stars Fun Lovin' Criminals.\n\n2004\nThe band spends some one and a half years working in the studio on the new album \"Sz\u00e1llj ki \u00e9s gyalogolj\", which sees the band return to a more stripped down sound reminiscent of their first few albums. The album includes several stand out tracks, including \"Ez a szerelem\", \"Hanger\u0151\", as well as \"Cs\u00edzb\u00f6rger\" and \"Taposs a sz\u00edvemen\". In Spring 2005 the album receives the prestigious MAHASZ Recording Prize in the Rock Album category. A change occurs in the band line up, as HS7 and guitarist G\u00e1bor Balczer decide to part ways following the release of the album. He is replaced by long time friend Zsolt \u00c1brah\u00e1m, former guitarist of the Szeged based band Id\u0151rabl\u00f3k and Neo. The new formation of HS7 starts work on new songs in Fall 2004.\n\n2005\nAs already mentioned, the album \"Sz\u00e1llj ki \u00e9s gyalogolj\" receives in Spring 2005 the MAHASZ recording prize in the rock album category. In December 2005, the band begins work on their next studio album, which sees HS7 reunited with the sound engineer\/production partner D\u00e1vid Schram, who also worked on \"Sz\u00e1llj ki \u00e9s gyalogolj\".\n\n2006\nMuch is happening in HS7 in the start of 2006! The band is busy preparing their new album in the studio, but this work is briefly interrupted by a very exciting event. The band travels to Cannes, France due to their nomination for the higly prestigious European Breakthrough Award of the Border Breakers Awards of MIDEM by MTV Europe, MIDEM and the European Music Office. HS7 are happy to receive the nomination, and even more happy when they win the award! Winning the award is all the more impressive considering that there were more than a hundred bands contesting for the prize from the new EU member states. In May 2005, HS7 release their new album \"Tudom, hogy szeretsz titokban\". The new album, which is also the debut for guitarist Zsolt Abraham, is hailed by most music critics as the bands most accomplished and best album to date. The album is praised for its dynamic, complex, and subversive beauty. Also, the title track of the album is relased as a free EP via the internet on www.tudomhogyszeretsztitokban.com, something almost unheard of in Hungary. The band continues touring, headlining many successful concerts, as well as playing together with such international acts as Radiohead, Morrissey and The Church.\n\n2007\nThe band released the english version of \"Tudom, hogy szeretsz titokban\". The release called Sordid Little Symphonies. The band played some gigs but they wasn't so active in this year.\n\n2008\nIn 2008 the band recorded they 8th studio album wich will be allow to download legal on \"http:\/\/hs7.blog.hu\" for one week from 10th of November.\n\n\n\nMembers:\nSz\u0171cs Kriszti\u00e1n (vocals, guitar) 1995-\nN\u00e9meth R\u00f3bert (bass guitar) 1995-\nOrb\u00e1n Gyula (drums) 1995-\nTak\u00e1cs Zolt\u00e1n Japp\u00e1n (keyboards) 1998-\n\u00c1brah\u00e1m Zsolt (guitar) 2004-\n\nFormer members:\nKiss Endre (guitar) 1995-1996\nBalczer G\u00e1bor (guitar) 1995-2004\nBalanyi Szil\u00e1rd (keyboards) 1996-1998 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Heaven+Street+Seven\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Venturing out to play live, both as a duo and with the addition of various musicians and friends, the band - which has been compared by critics to acts ranging from Fleetwood Mac to Pretenders to REM - was a regular part of New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village music scene during the mid-to-late 1990s.

He is best known for his work with Talib Kweli on his Reflection Eternal album and on Black Star.\n\nEarly career\nHi-Tek started his rap career with hip hop group Mood and had a regional hit with \"Hustle on the Side\". That song was made for Mood's album Doom, which featured amongst others Brooklyn MC Talib Kweli. Talib and Hi-Tek clicked immediately, and Hi-Tek went on to produce most of Talib Kweli and Mos Def's Black Star (1998). In 2000, Tek and Kweli (under the name Reflection Eternal) released Train of Thought (2000) on Rawkus Records, with raps by Talib Kweli and beats by Hi-Tek. It enjoyed moderate crossover radio success with the single \"The Blast\" and eventually earned Gold status in record sales. The pair have yet to release a follow-up album due to creative differences.\n\nCurrent career\nAfter signing to Rawkus Records, Tek produced for some of their projects, including the popular Soundbombing series, a three-record compilation of Rawkus artists. During his tenure there, he grew unhappy with their treatment of him, such as a time they forced him to give a beat he'd produced for Snoop Dogg to label signee Kool G Rap, who didn't want the beat.\n\nIn 2001, he released his solo album Hi-Teknology on Rawkus. The album featured raps by artists like Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Vinia Mojica, Buckshot, and others, all produced by Hi-Tek. It received some critical acclaim and spawned a minor hit \"Round and Round\" with Cincinnati singer Jonell.\n\nAlthough the record sold over 250,000 copies, Hi-Tek wasn't pleased with the job Rawkus did with his album, and he left the label shortly after its release. He then signed to MCA Records after the song \"Round and Round\" became an underground hit. While signed to MCA, Hi-Tek produced the album Hi-Teknology 2 and produced Jonell's debut album for Def Jam, though neither of these albums were released.\n\nCurrently, Hi-Tek is working as a staff producer for Aftermath Entertainment and its affiliates, as well as past associates such as Kweli and Mos Def. He is also recording songs for Dion, an R&B singer signed to Aftermath. Hi-Teknology 2 was released October 17, 2006 on Babygrande, and distributed by Koch Entertainment.

He first appeared on albums from The Beatnuts on the track \"Off the Books\" and on Fat Joe's second album Jealous One's Envy, on the track \"Watch Out\", prior to signing to Loud Records as a solo artist. Big Pun's career was cut short in 2000 at age 28 by a fatal heart attack due to his obesity. He is survived by a wife, Liza Rios, and three children. Big Pun was the first solo Latino rapper to sell over one million LPs. His first stage name was Big Moon Dawg. His name comes from the Marvel comic book anti-hero The Punisher.\n\nChildhood\n\nBorn in the South Bronx of Puerto Rican descent during the early years of hip-hop, Christopher Rios grew up enjoying basketball, boxing, and other sports. He met his wife Liza in the eighth grade. At the age of five, he broke his leg in a Manhattan municipal park, resulting in a lawsuit against the City of New York, later settled out of court. He received a lot of money in compensation. By all accounts from Pun's family, his early years were very difficult, including witnessing his mother's drug abuse, his father leaving the family, and a stepfather who was very hard on Pun. According to his grandmother, Pun would become angry and self-destructive, punching holes in the walls of his family's apartment and eating the chunks of drywall rocks . At the age of 17, Rios dropped out of Stevenson High School and for some time was homeless, staying in abandoned buildings or at friends' homes.\n\nCareer\n\nSometime during the '80s, he formed the Full a Clips Crew with Triple Seis, Prospect and Cuban Link who was at the time named \"Lyrical Assassin\". At this point Big Pun was operating under the alias Big Moon Dawg. Rios met fellow Puerto Rican and Bronx rapper Fat Joe in 1995 and made his commercial debut on Joe's second album, Jealous One's Envy, in addition to appearing on a b-side to Joe's \"Envy\" single, \"Fire Water.\"\n\nLater, \"I'm Not a Player\" (featuring an O'Jays sample) was supported by a significant advertising campaign and became an underground hit. The song's remix, \"Still Not a Player\" (featuring Joe), became Big Pun's first major mainstream hit. His full-length debut Capital Punishment followed in 1998, and was the first album by a solo Latino rapper to go platinum, peaking at #5 on the Billboard 200. Capital Punishment was also nominated for a Grammy, but lost out on the award to Jay-Z's Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life. He became a member of The Terror Squad, a New York-based group of rappers founded by Fat Joe, with most of the roster supplied by the now-defunct Full a Clips Crew.\n\nDeath\n\nDespite his athletic adolescence, Big Pun struggled with his weight for most of his life; his weight fluctuated in the early 90's between obese and morbidly obese. In the last years of his life he fluctuated between 450 and 697 pounds. Big Pun enrolled in a weight-loss program in North Carolina, in which he lost 100 pounds, but he eventually quit the program before completing it, returning to New York and gaining back the weight he had lost. On February 7, 2000, Big Pun suffered a fatal heart attack and respiratory failure in a hotel, Crowne Plaza, in White Plains, NY.\n\n\nPosthumous works\n\nHis second album, Yeeeah Baby, completed before his death, was issued as scheduled in April 2000. It peaked at #3 on the Billboard charts and earned gold record status within three months of its release. It eventually went platinum. A second posthumous album, Endangered Species, was released in April of 2001. Endangered Species collected some of Pun's \"greatest hits,\" previously unreleased material, numerous guest appearances, and remixed \"greatest verses.\" As with his other albums, it also peaked in the top ten of the Billboard 200, reaching #7, but didn't sell as much as the previous Pun albums had.\n\nIn recent times, Big Punisher was featured with Fat Joe on \"Duets: The Final Chapter,\" an album of tracks featuring the Notorious B.I.G, also deceased. The track \"Get Your Grind On\" begins with a Big Pun radio interview in which he said he would perform a duet with Biggie at the gates of heaven. Punisher was also featured on a track from the revived Terror Squad's second album, True Story, on the track \"Bring 'Em Back\" with Big L.\n\nSony Records has been considering releasing a second posthumous album featuring unreleased material, but the project is being delayed by Sony. Liza Rios also held an auction in 2005 for her deceased husband's Terror Squad medallion, citing financial difficulties in the wake of Pun's death, and again claiming to have not received any royalty checks for Pun's posthumous album sales (save for a small check from the sales of Endangered Species).\n\nLyrical ability and technique\n\nBig Pun rapped at high speeds. He used huge multies and internal rhyme schemes. He showcased his punchline capabilities on 'Dream Shatterer', multies and flow in 'Twinz', 'You ain't a Killer' and 'Boomerang'. He was influenced heavily by Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane. He also showcased superior topic versatility ranging from street life to sex\/relationships and politics to social injustice. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Big+Pun\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

They are one of the earliest and most successful of the many Wu-Tang affiliates that emerged in the mid-to-late 1990's. Originally consisting of New York rappers 9th Prince (RZA's younger brother), Islord, Dom Pachino, Killa Sin and Ohio producer 4th Disciple, they added Beretta 9 and ShoGun Assasson to the roster in 1996, also from Ohio. They distinguish themselves from the other affiliates with gritty subject matter, differing from the standard subject matter of martial arts common to Wu-Tang and their affilates and focusing on themes of military and combat.\n\nKillarmy released numerous singles from 1995 to 1997, including \"Swinging Swords\" and \"Camouflage Ninjas\" as well as the Sunz Of Man collaborations \"Wake Up\" and \"Soldiers of Darkness\". The album Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars was released in 1997 just after the release of the Wu-Tang Clan's second album, as well as a 12\" single containing two tracks from the album, \"Wu-Renegades\" and \"Clash of the Titans\". Shortly after the group's manager General Wise was shot dead in Steubenville, but the group pressed on undeterred, appearing on the Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm compilation and each making numerous appearances on other Wu-Tang projects from the Clansmen themselves and from other affiliates. The group's second album Dirty Weaponry was released in 1998 and the third, Fear, Love & War was released on September 11, 2001. In 2002, the group received some controversy following the Washington D.C. sniper attacks. On an episode of Tim Russert's Meet the Press, Russert and Montgomery County police chief Charles Moose stated that Killarmy influenced the shootings, and referenced a number of lyrics to support the claims. Despite the press attention, nothing materialized from the accusations. In 2002, Dom Pachino became the first group member to release a solo album, with Tera Iz Him. 9th Prince followed in 2003 with his solo debut Granddaddy Flow.

In 1987, the trio consisted of Dominican-American Louise Sabater (who is also known as Angel Clivill\u00e9s), Caroline Jackson and Sunshine Wright. They were the one of the first acts to bring freestyle music to the pop charts, having a string of moderate hits in the late eighties. Their debut album \"Show Me\" produced five Billboard Hot 100 chart entries: \"Show Me\" (#44), \"Spring Love\" (#98), \"Because Of You\" (#27), \"Promise Me\" (#40) and \"Inside Outside\" (#55). The album and its singles are considered early classics of this musical genre.\n\nIn 1989, Wright was replaced by Margo Urban and more hits followed.

The singles from this album are \"I Need Your Lovin'\" and \"I Am Woman.\" The group went on hiatus after the release of \"Satisfy.\" In early 2012, Sabater, Jackson and Urban reunited and now tour as The Original Cover Girls. Wright is expected to rejoin the line-up as well in 2014. Until 2012, Sabater toured singing Cover Girls songs under the name 'Angel (The Original Cover Girl)'.

Known as \u201cThe Voice of New York\u201d, her afternoon radio show has consistently been ranked #1 with more young listeners than any other radio program in the country.\n\nAngie Martinez got her first break in radio at the age of 16 answering hot lines at the urban radio station WQHT (\"Hot 97\"). There she met popular DJ Funkmaster Flex, and began working as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Martinez quickly picked up on the craft of running a successful radio program. Executives at the station decided to give her a chance, even though she lacked on-air experience.\n\nAs an actress, Angie received small roles in independent hip hop films such as Blood is Thicker Than Water and Paper Soldiers. She then appeared in Brown Sugar starring Taye Diggs, Queen Latifah and Sanaa Lathan.\n\nIn 1996, Martinez was encouraged to give rapping a shot by friend KRS-One. She appeared on his track \"Heartbeat\" from his 1997 album I Got Next. After the song gained a strong fan following, another friend, Lil' Kim, offered her a spot on the \"Ladies Night Remix\" of her song \"Not Tonight\" for the Nothing to Lose soundtrack. Along with Missy Elliott, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes and Da Brat, the ladies enjoyed one of the most successful singles of 1997. It peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at #2, and reached #1 on the Hip-Hop \/ R&B charts and the Rap charts respectively. The single sold over 1,000,000 copies and was certified Platinum. The ladies were nominated for two Grammy Awards that year, and were also invited to perform the song live on The MTV Video Music Awards. A major label battle began to sign Martinez to a recording contract. Her appearance on other rapper's material was in high demand. She recorded songs with Mary J. Blige (\"Christmas in the City\"), Terror Squad (\"Freak Out\"), N.O.R.E. (\"Oh No Remix\"), Beenie Man (\"Tell Me Remix\") and Funkmaster Flex & Big Kap's compilation album The Tunnel (\"Wow\"). She also recorded interludes for mixtapes by Kid Capri, DJ Clue and DJ Kayslay. In 2001, she appeared in the music video for Jay-Z and R. Kelly's \"Guilty Until Proven Innocent\".\n\nOn April 17, 2001, she finally issued her oft-delayed debut album, Up Close and Personal. The album included production by DJ Clue, Salaam Remi, Knobody and RocWilder among others, and featured guest appearances by Jay-Z, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Wyclef Jean, Busta Rhymes and Kool G. Rap. The first single, \"Dem Thangzzz\" was produced by The Neptunes, and also featured background vocals by Pharrell Williams and Q-Tip. The track failed to make a strong impression at radio, but the album enjoyed strong first week sales. It debuted at #32 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart, and #10 on the Billboard Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Charts selling 69,000 its first week. The second single, \"Coast 2 Coast\" (Suavamente) featuring rapper Wyclef Jean re-sparked interest in the album. She promoted the album with magazine posters, in-store signings, club appearances and television appearances with MTV and BET. The record received mixed reviews from critics, but like Martinez herself, was strongly accepted in the hip hop community. The album sold a low 325,000 units.\n\nFollowing her first album's release, Angie began work on a second record Animal House. In order to build anticipation for the record, she appeared on BET's Rap City and began a nation-wide radio tour. She recorded a verse for the remix to her Artist Sacario record \"Live Big\". It became the number one record in the tri-state area and coincidentally coincided with the release of Martinez's first single from her second album, \"If I Could Go\" which also featured Sacario and singer Lil' Mo. \"If I Could Go\" became a huge crossover hit on pop radio, climbing into the top 10 on The Billboard Hot 100 Chart. It became the #1 played on urban radio in 2002. The album, Animal House (named after Martinez's own production company and recording posse), was released on August 21, 2002. It entered the Billboard Hot 200 Albums Chart at #11, and the Billboard Hot Hip-Hop \/ R&B Charts selling 92,000 units in its first week. The follow-up single, \"Take You Home\" featuring R&B singer Kelis didn't receive as much attention, but it did become a minor hit that winter. The album was more strongly received by critics and fans. Following the release of the album, she was featured on a remix for labelmate Lil' Mo's track \"Gangster\", and Nina Sky's hype single \"Time to Go\". Following this she announced she was retiring from the recording industry to concentrate on her other projects.\n\nShe has a son Niko Ruffin (born June 12, 2003) with Tamir \"Nokio\" Ruffin of Dru Hill. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Angie+Martinez\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Backbone is based in Atlanta, GA. \n\nBorn and bred in the S.W.A.T.S. section of Atlanta, Backbone connected with the other members of the Dungeon Family around 1990. Led by producers Organized Noize and rap crews Outkast and Goodie Mob, the Georgia-based collective ushered in the modern day version of Southern hip-hop with the 1993 release of Outkast's \"Player's Ball\" single.\n\nSince then, Backbone has worked with Outkast on their third and fourth albums, as well as with Goodie Mob on their second and third releases. He toured with the Mob in support of their Still Standing album in 1998, which took him overseas.\n\nLike much of Goodie Mob's material, Backbone's music focuses on political commentary informed by the experience of being a young black male raised in the racially charged South.\n\n\"We being black men from the ages of 16 to 25, most of us don't understand that the game [of life in America] is set up to destroy us, literally,\" he said. \"If you're going to be out in the streets, like they say when you're little, look both ways before you cross so you don't get hit. You've got to respect this game before you get in it. You've got to be cautious and read the street signs. I want to go into the depths of the community and reach the youngest of the Gs. I want them to realize that the game is a set-up and we're losing.\"\n\n3. Backbone is a short lived band featuring  Bill Kreutzmann of Grateful Dead. They released one album titled  \"Backbone\" in 1998.\n\n4. Backbone nu\/groove metal band from Serbia. Active during mid 2000s. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Backbone\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Often sounding more like Stereolab than any other point of reference, the group's unique sound and image led to a deal with Anticon Records (a collective that Bryant belongs to), which released their 2002 eponymous debut, as well as 2008's TV Loves You Back. ~ Bradley Torreano, Rovi\n\nRestiform Bodies are David Bryant-vocalist and song writer, Matt Valerio- percussionist and beat-maker & George Chadwick-synth, sample and effects slayer. In 2000 they made a tape called \"Oubliette,\" and caught the attention of Oakland's then young experimental hip hop collective, anticon. Once in Oakland RB began what they refer to affectionately as an adventure in \"total career ambivalence\".Repeatedly dodging the bullet of a follow up to their S\/T release on anticon's deceased in-house distributor and label imprint, 6 months distribution, the three focused instead on developing songs for performance with live electronics, resulting in a metric ton of songs and zero grams of vinyl. The joke is that the three can seldom be found in the same room, even though they lived together for all intents and purposes throughout high school, which may ironically be the puzzle buster of their story. Since 2000 Restiform Bodies have toured in support of their self titled LP (an organized version of the bedroom cassette) and their various individual projects. They have each recorded at the very least one solo release, and at last their debut record for anticon, TV LOVES YOU BACK, which may or may not pay off the computer. \n\nSound check casualties include but are not limited to: Sole, Dose One, Alias, Why?

His career has spanned over 24 years, during which he has released eleven albums. According to the He's a Mental Giant Songfacts, his stage name originated from the TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun, given to him by rapper Black Walt due to his fast rhyming style. (Tech is short for technique and 9 is the number of completion. That's why he says the technique's complete so often.)\n\nHis tenth studio album, K.O.D., was released October 27, 2009. He has spent his illustrious career making sure he\u2019s been grinding harder than the average rapper, and is the best selling artist out of his hometown. With nine solo albums and two powerhouse collaboration projects under his belt, the Kansas City MC\u2019s flow is sharper and slicker than it\u2019s ever been.\n\u201cThis is another roller coaster ride,\u201d explains TECH N9NE about the release.  \u201cWhen it came time for Sickology 101, I knew I wanted to do a collabo album based on the study of being sick. It\u2019s a beginner\u2019s course for people who don\u2019t know how to be sick lyrically or how to choose sick beats. It all starts with beats because they tell me exactly what to do.\u201d Epic beats from YoungFyre, Wyshmaster, Seven and Matic Lee set the stage for TECH N9NE to weave his introspective and sometimes roguish lyrics around. \n\nSickology 101 brims with stellar appearances from lyrical heavyweights. On the opening title track, TECH N9NE slays alongside Chino XL and Crooked I, pulling listeners into the Hip-Hop classroom for a lesson in murdering a beat. It\u2019s a twisted vision forged on undeniable grooves and quixotic wordplay. \n\nThe single, \u201cNothin,\u2019\u201d is an inspiring, honest anthem that features Messy Marv and Big Scoob. Meanwhile, on \u201cMidwest Choppers 2,\u201d TECH N9NE and Krayzie Bone cruise to the depths of darkness. \u201cKrayzie Bone came through and murdered it,\u201d says TECH N9NE. \u201cI modeled the song after movies. When you do a sequel, there has to be a bigger body count and more people have to die. \u2018Midwest Choppers 2\u2019 is Autobahn-style. It makes you want to speed.\u201d \n\nTECH N9NE\u2019s inimitable flow and rhyming take center stage on solo tracks, including the haunting, hypnotic \u201cRed Nose.\u201d He doesn\u2019t pull any punches on the vitriolic, YoungFyre-produced \u201cBlown Away,\u201d either. It\u2019s an open letter to several prominent urban artists who refused to play before him at radio festivals despite his massive concert draw. \n\nWith hits like \u201cI\u2019m A Playa,\u201d \u201cCaribou Lou\u201d (which boasts 7.2 million MySpace plays), \u201cRiotmaker,\u201d \u201cLike Yeah\u201d and \u201cEverybody Move,\u201d it\u2019s no wonder TECH N9NE counts a total of over 4.5 million YouTube video plays and an average of 40,000 MySpace visitors each day. His success knows no limits. The July 2008 release, Killer, debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart and Number 12 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. He did it all on his own. There was no major label \u2014 just TECH N9NE\u2019s own record company, Strange Music. TECH N9NE\u2019s tracks have appeared in films like Gang Related and Alpha Dog as well as various TV shows, and he recently made his motion picture debut in The Life of Lucky Cucumber alongside members of MTV\u2019s \u201cJackass\u201d crew. \n\nIt hasn\u2019t been an easy road, but TECH N9NE soldiers on and he\u2019ll never stop. \u201cThey call me devil worshipper because I\u2019m different. I give you music for my core. They\u2019re the people that put me over the million mark. I raise my middle finger to everybody who judges me because my core audience is there for me. They will always love me, but I\u2019m trying to reach others, too. It\u2019s not over. My music is supposed to be for everybody, but some people just don\u2019t get it. This album is the result; swallow it. It\u2019s middle finger music, all-day and all-night.\u201d \n\nTECH N9NE never stops bringing that music directly to his fans, constantly reinforcing his status as one of the hardest-touring rap acts in the business.  In 2008, TECH N9NE performed over 200 shows and he doesn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down in 2009.  In April, TECH will head out in support of Sickology 101 and spend two months on the road, performing live for his rabid fans.   \n\nSickology 101 is prepping the world for TECH N9NE\u2019s next masterpiece, K.O.D. \u201cI want people to know that I\u2019m getting better and better and I\u2019m a machine. I do these collabo albums to give the fans more. This is a bridge record to K.O.D. It\u2019s the farewell to the TECH N9NE you\u2019ve known lately. It\u2019s getting darker. A lot of people might not be able to go to the place I\u2019m going, but this place is my specialty.\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need people to kiss my hand,\u201d assures TECH N9NE. \u201cI\u2019m not trippin\u2019 on status, and I\u2019m not a narcissist when it comes to rap. It\u2019s my heart and soul pouring onto the paper. I write my life and I can\u2019t hold back.

A house-centric alter-ego of Praveen Sharma (of Sepalcure, Praveen & Beno\u00eet)\n2. MC from Portland, Oregon.\n3. Hardcore band, probably active in the 90's.\n4. A hardcore punk band from Philadelphia, PA that has been active since 2012. http:\/\/braillephiladelphia.bandcamp.com\/\n\n1) As the house-oriented solo project of Praveen Sharma (see Sepalcure, Praveen, and Praveen & Benoit), Braille combines classic chicago house vocals with deep, dubby melodic elements, all under the pulse of post-dubstep-influenced, sub-dominating bass. His debut EP, The Year 3000, is slated for a May, 2011 release on Rush Hour.\n\n2) Always on a musical mission, BRAILLE has become one of rap\u2019s best-kept secrets.  He has released three solo albums, performed throughout the U.S., Europe and Japan with artists like the late James Brown, De La Soul and others, been named one of the \u201cNext 100\u201d by URB magazine and collaborated with rap heavyweights such as 9th Wonder, CunninLyguists, and Pigeon John.  All of these accomplishments set the stage for Braille\u2019s fourth album, the splendid The IV Edition (Syntax Records).\n\nIn addition to being his fourth album, the title represents three other things.   Braille wants the album to serve as an IV to distribute musical medicine for social illnesses directly into the veins of the society.  IV also stands for \u201cInternational Vision\u201d (becoming more aware of what's going on in the world around us) and \u201cInternational Version\u201d (the album is made for an international audience and features German, French, Finish and Australian producers like M-Phazes, Aetoms, Staffro, etc).\n\nThe album\u2019s title song serves as an ode to Braille\u2019s rap roots.  Produced by Marco Polo and featuring scratches from Rob Swift, the energetic, drum-driven tune is a lyrical showcase that caters to rap\u2019s tremendous subterranean following.  \u201cThe underground hip-hop base is a lot bigger than people think it is,\u201d Braille reveals.  \u201cSometimes when people think of the word underground, they think of basement albums that just get dubbed on tape.  So I\u2019m sticking to my roots.  I believe that the audience for lyricism and good hip-hop is much larger than most people assume.  I wanted to start with the hip-hop base and take it from there.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Braille acknowledges his personal and artistic history on \u201cRemember Your Path\u201d and channels the energy of music icon James Brown on \u201cMain Squeeze,\u201d with whom Braille toured as an opening act during 2005 and 2006.  Then on \u201cCalculated Risk\u201d Braille gets personal by examining his decision to pursue and create lyric and beat-drive rap music with spiritual overtones.  It\u2019s been a full time mission since 1999.  \u201cThis could really end up being really detrimental to my career.  I understand the risk of doing what I\u2019ve done thus far.  I understand the risk that I might not make it, that people might not buy my records.  I understand those risks, but it\u2019s still worth it to me to put everything into a making a record the way I want it to sound and not worry about what\u2019s going on in the industry and on the radio.\u201d  \n\nBraille was attracted to hip-hop at a young age.  Hearing the variety of different styles and artists that existed during the early- to mid-\u201890s, Braille was inspired by the idea that he could write songs based on his own personal experiences and that he didn't have to fit into any specific stereotypes.  One group that was fundamental in Braille's development at the time was A Tribe Called Quest, who changed his outlook on music with its landmark 1993 album Midnight Marauders.  Rap was in the midst of a gangster rap renaissance at the time and the album\u2019s uplifting, positive vibe gave the then teen-aged Braille a boost.   \u201cHearing people talk from different perspectives, I started to realize, \u2018Hey, I could make music and still be myself,\u2019\u201d the Portland-raised rapper recalls today.  \u201cIt was fine that I grew up where I grew up.  My size, stature and my personality are all attributes.  They\u2019re not negatives.  That\u2019s just who I am, so I felt that if I embraced those things, then I could do whatever I wanted with it.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, Braille had more to worry about than music.  Born in Portland, he and his family relocated to New Jersey when he was in high school.  During his stay on the east coast, his family went bankrupt and returned to Portland to live with Braille\u2019s grandmother.  However, Braille enjoyed being close to Philadelphia and New York and decided to stay by himself on the East Coast.  In 1999, when he was 17, independent startup ESWP music released his first album, Lifefirst: Half The Battle.\n\nThe battle to survive proved too tough, so Braille moved back to Portland only to find out there was no room in the house for him.  He took a bus to Los Angeles in order to pursue a career in music.  After a year in LA, he went back to Oregon and met the woman that would eventually become his wife.  With music dreams, no high school diploma and newfound responsibility, Braille and his future wife started a business cleaning out repossessed homes.  \n\nThat wasn\u2019t the work Braille wanted to do, so he and his wife moved out of their place, put their stuff in storage and lived out of their van while they toured around the United States doing concerts.  They didn\u2019t ask for payment at shows.  With no bills, they sold merchandise to pay for gas and food.  \u201cI didn't have many career options because I spent most of my teenage years working on music,\u201d Braille says.  \u201cThat\u2019s where I invested all of my time, so I was willing to make some sacrifices in order to continue pursuing it.\u201d\n\nFortunately, the more Braille pursued his dream of making a living making music, the more real that dream became.  He buckled down and in 2004 released his second album, Shades of Grey.  The collection featured collaborations with 9th Wonder (Jay-Z, Destiny\u2019s Child) and Rob Swift and laid the foundation for a successful career.  Thanks to such powerful, politically minded songs as \u201cKeep On,\u201d it was easy for URB magazine to tap Braille one of their \u201cNext 100.\u201d  \n\nThe following year, Braille\u2019s newly formed label Hiphop IS Music released his third album, Box of Rhymes.  Following the album\u2019s release he would experience the joy of becoming a father as well as the pain of loosing one.  The IV Edition deals with these issues and provides an outlook compromising of social change, spiritual beliefs, confidence and the ability to carry on.\n\nThough he did not grow up in a spiritual household, Braille found the spiritual references he encountered in rap encouraging and decided to act upon them.  \u201cI believed there was something out there,\u201d Braille says, \u201cand I started out trying to be a positive person.  I felt a gut on my heart and I eventually ended up meeting this other artist, Trust One, and when we got together, I thought we were going to talk about hip-hop.  He told me more about God and I started on my path as a follower of Christ.  That had a big impact on the direction I took in life and as an artist\"\n\n3) No info about them, released a demo tape.\n\n4) Four Adult Males from Philadelphia. 90s-influenced hardcore punk with its own unique twist.

Epic is a Melodic Black Metal band from France - formed in 1996. They have released one demo and one full-length album.  After the release of their one and only full-length album they split up but, were cherished for their small releases pertaining to the evil ages of dark, old culture after the Roman era. \n\nThe bands over-all sound conveys a traditional Black Metal style similar to Satyricon and even have some Medieval touches in the synthesizers. The guitar and drums are very quiet and there are very few signs of much bass-like entities however, the synthesizers generally dominate the whole Atmosphere and feature occasional string, Symphonic verses. The vocals feature both clean, bitter evil sounds and common Black Metal vocals but, are increased in volume.\n\nEpic is from a suburban town in Paris called Cr\u00e9teil. Although, their styles have never moved in the direction of French culture, their lyrics may pertain potentially to the Catholic aspects followed in France. They have a hatred and historical captivation for the war of Christianity. Their album somewhat portrays the war of Christianity perishing on earth, which they feel leaves the world in better conditions. \n\nThe band generally has seven members and occasionally a cello player named Sir Meliador but, the main lineup includes; Emrys Evallach of Belostheme - Vocals, Lord Silmaeth - Lead Guitar, Lord Hyphares - Backup Guitar, Lady Morrigan'n - Bass, Lord Korgan - Keyboards and Knight Hydraoth - Drums. All of the members have been in several well-known French Black Metal bands and others such as Mayhem. The band carried on their side-project work in the band called Love Lies Bleeding. \n\nIn March of 1997 the band released a small demo called \"Like a Swan Forever\". The demo contained four songs including an outro. One or two of them were featured in their only album. They were discovered by  Ancestral Craft Productions and in 1998 release \"Of Tears and Blood\u2026\".\n\n2). Epic (Erin Patrick Carroll) is a Canadian underground hip-hop rapper. He has four releases on Clothes Horse Records.\n\nPossibly one of the most recognizable character in hip hop, Epic made underground hip hop heads take notice with his releases 8:30 in Newfoundland and Heater in My Truck. Epic's unorthodox flow and refreshing wit instigated a critical outpouring from the underground hip hop community. A capable, entertaining freestyler, he continues to hone his craft at public venues, community radio stations, parks, parties and parking lots.\n\nFor those who have downloaded (for free from clotheshorserecords.com!) his debut 8:30 In Newfoundland you\u2019ll know that Epic is a general all-around champ. A Federal Government employee, former truck driver, student loan dodger, hockey fan, beer-sharer, bus-to-worker in search of a decent relationship and someone to beatbox for, Carroll will eat half of your Kraft Dinner and buy you a replacement box next paycheque. He became your best friend after one spin of 8:30, pretty much put Newfoundland on the hip hop map (although do go find Johnny Hardcore\u2019s disc for a great Newf-rap listen), writes songs about corrupt Saskatchewan cops who leave First Nations Canadians to die in frozen prairie fields, and recounts the plight of the Walmart shopping-cart attendants who lost their jobs \u201cfor thoss eagulle automated 25 cent return\u201d carts. Epic cares in an irresistibly charismatic, so-Canadian, wheatfield-metropolis way. That Gord Downie meets Jack Kerouac meets Henry Rollins kind of way.\n\nBut he rhymes like Fargo.\n\nThe drawl of the Dirty South, the Hotlanta Twang, the Staten Slur and even the T-dot Regg-Eh Chat have all met their match in the Prairie Peep. Carroll is a field mouse with a bullhorn, but as such he\u2019s also the glaring exception to Guru\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Mostly The Voice\u201d rule. Epic\u2019s notably downhome perspective and subject matter lend an inexplicably airtight \u201chip hop\u201d authenticity to his words despite the obvious Frances McDormand influence\n\n3). there's also a danish underground metal-core band called Epic.\n\n4).

The Herd is a hip-hop group from suburban Sydney. They have released four full-length albums since 2001's self-titled debut. Unusually for a hip-hop outfit, The Herd's full band format permits dynamic live shows. \n\nThe Herd's members include MCs Ozi Batla, Urthboy and Berzerkatron, Unkle Ho (beats), Traksewt (piano accordion, clarinet and beats), Sulo (beats and guitar), Toe-fu (guitar), Rok Poshtya (bass) and singer Jane Tyrrell. Their songs often feature politically-oriented lyrics.\n\nTheir first single to attract Triple J airplay was the superficially humorous 'Scallops' in 2001. Later tracks included '77%' which featured the line \"77% of Aussies are racist\", referring to the number of Australians announced in a survey that agreed with the Australian federal government's response to the MV Tampa incident, and 'Burn Down the Parliament', which was to be interpreted metaphorically, but unfortunately was released the same week as the January 2003 Canberra bushfires.\n\n77% scored well on the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2003, coming in at number 46.\n\nThe Herd released their third album \"The Sun Never Sets\" in 2005, featuring the single 'We Can't Hear You'. Their subjects ranged from their well-known anti-war stance and anti-corporatism to more personal topics like divorce and slow death of the Australian outback\/country.\n\nIn October 2005, The Herd featured on Triple J's 'Like a Version' (acoustic covers) segment. They performed their own version of the famous Australian song 'A Walk in the Light Green' by Redgum (better known as 'I Was Only 19').

After a UK singles chart near-miss with \"I Can Fly\" (1967), the haunting \"From The Underworld\" reached number six, with help from copious plays on pirate radio later that year. This was followed by \"Paradise Lost\", which made it up to number fifteen in 1968.\n\nTheir greatest success came with \"I Don't Want Our Loving to Die\", a number-five hit (also in 1968).\n\nWith his boyish photogenic looks, guitarist Peter Frampton was dubbed 'The Face of '68' by teen magazine \"Rave\". Steele then left the group, to be replaced by Henry Spinetti. Dissatisfied with mere teen idol status, and disappointed with the failure of their next single \"Sunshine Cottage\", Frampton left to form Humble Pie with Steve Marriott.\n\nThe remaining Bown and Spinetti made another flop single \"The Game\", then formed the short-lived Judas Jump with Mike Smith and Allen Jones, saxophonists from Amen Corner, and Welsh vocalist Adrian Williams. Taylor, who became a disc jockey, and Steele, reunited briefly for a one-off single \"You Got Me Hangin' From Your Lovin' Tree\" in 1971, to almost universal lack of interest..\n\nAccording to sleeve notes on their 1967 album Paradise Lost, drummer Andrew Steele was the first man in Britain to successfully boomerang a banana.

Although born in Tallahassee, he was raised in Jacksonville, Florida, where he eventually made a name for himself as a well known gospel rapper capable of producing an authentic dirty south sound, typically rare for the Christian rap genre because most of the great Christian emcees focus on spouting the underground sound. He currently lives in and produces his music out of Nashville, Tennessee.\nIn the early years of his life, Dewayne Petty was familiar with the concept of a \"dysfunctional childhood\". As a child, he experienced the painful emotional trauma of being molested. As he grew older, Dewayne began working the streets as a hustler. At a cruicial point in his life, Pettidee realized he needed salvation from drugs and the typical street life of a hustler. Through God, Dewayne accepted salvation through Jesus Christ, and quickly realized God's will for his life. Dewayne had always had a talent with music and rapping, and so he soon quickly decided to use this gift as an outlet for evangelism. In 1998, Pettidee as an artist was born. Pettidee quickly transitioned from creating basic amateur loops on his boom box (as he did in his youth) to writing and producing his own Christian hip hop music from scratch. Pettidee is actively on tour in the United States, most commonly seen putting on shows with well known rap group GRITS, whom Pettidee holds a personal friendship with. Pettidee also speaks with youth at juvenile shelters, inmates in prison, and often holds public speeches regarding his life, ministry, and salvation through Jesus Christ. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Pettidee\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The members of the band became acquainted in Arbat street, got keen on \u201cstreet\u201d culture: break-dance, rap, they arranged street performances and competitions. At that time no one could think of setting rap, popular in North America, to hard-edged texts about sex in Russian. The theme itself was at least under control of TV and radio if not prohibited at all. \u201cMaltshishnik\u201d shocked everyone. Some weeks later sex made crazy the whole Russia of \u201ctransition period\u201d. Making records, ceaseless concert tours, popularity, censorship and, finally, underground. \n\nIn details: \n\nIn 1991 \u201cZeCo\u201d company put on the market the first album of the band \u201cLet\u2019s Talk about Sex\u201d in cassettes and discs, the album became a hit. Because of vacuum in Russian audio market, because of arrangement novelty and originality, the first album was a success. That year there took places some changes: the company of Pavel Galkin, Mutabor, and Andrey Kotov, Den, was joined a new person Andrey Lysikov, Dolphin, who helped to formulate the conception of the band: epatage rap adapted to Russian audience. \n\nTrack \u201cSex Nonstop\u201d is typical for the period. After it was shown on the first TV channel broke a scandal, as a result \u201c50\/50\u201d station program editor was dismissed. That was the moment when problems began not only with TV, and with radio and press. In order to take part in TV show \u201cPloshchadka Muzoboza\u201d (\u201cMusical string ground\u201d) Den, Dolphin and Mutabor urgently had to record a phonogram that could pass TV censorship, they had one night. It was track \u201cDances\u201d. \n\nIn 1992 RDM company produced the first CD of the band called \u201cMiss Big Breast\u201d with such hits as \u201cBreasts, Breasts\u201d, \u201cAt the Last Time\u201d, \u201cPornography\u201d. It got difficult to find tickets for their concerts, it didn\u2019t depend on the size of the concert ground. For instance in Moscow at the presentation of the new album the multi-purpose sport hall \u201cDruzhba\u201d couldn\u2019t admit all the willing persons. They had to arrange extra concerts. And in Saint-Petersburg Ledovy Palace was crowded the whole week! \n\nAutumn 1994 saw the production of a new album \u201cKegli\u201d (\u201cNinepins\u201d). The conception of the band is basically the same, but texts grow ruder and the disks are marked \u201cObscene language\u201d. Despite the rhythm and a kind of pops the changes strengthened the scandalous reputation of the band worsening relations with mass media hammering \u201cMaltshishnik\u201d in deeper underground. \n\nIn the same year developing a new album the musicians decided to disband the band as the project became rather cramped to bring to live their ideas. Dolphin took solo project using in his start album \u201cNot in the focus\u201d music of the latest unpublished works of \u201cMaltshishnik\u201d, Den and Mutabor opened a project of rude alternative electronic music called \u201cBarbitura\u201d. In 1996 \u2013 2005 \u201cBarbitura\u201d produced seven albums, some live-shows gaining the popularity all over the country and abroad. \n\nSince 2000 the history of the band \u2013 \u201calive nostalgia\u201d \u2013 continues but as a studio project. \u201cMaltshishnik\u201d in the initial form \u201cDen \u2013 Mutabor\u201d produse an album \u201cSandals\u201d that is spread all over the CIS thanks to distribution company \u201cClassic Company\u201d. It was a blessing for the fans as the crazy inflammatory songs came back to them renewed and more interesting. The album attracted new fans as well. Meanwhile mass media go on boycotting the band. There are no new tracks of the band in any play-list of any radio and TV channel. The album is discussed only in Internet but in a very active way since the present and the past of the band attract all kinds of fans. \n\nIn 2002 a new album \u201cOglobla\u201d (\u201cShaft\u201d) was released. Great changes took place in the style of performance, arrangements and text composing. The quality of the product is evident. The album is magnificent. An unusual combination of vocal, texts and music can lead to the only conclusion: the guys are real professionals and the years of work bring their fruit. \n\nIn 2003 \u201cMalchishnik\u201d plays in public for the first time in almost ten year break. The concert was held at Ledovii Dvorec (the Ice Palace) in St. Petersburg with the \u201csold out\u201d notice. Having sung their best songs, Dan and Mutabor confirmed once again their unique status at Russian stage and proved that the interest for the band decreased in the least, but on the contrary increased. As a result, the new album ensued to be much better, than \u201cBest\u201d released in 1999. \n\nIn 2004 there was a release of the album \u201cPena\u201d (\u201cThe Foam\u201d). The music on this record is much softer, than on previous ones, but nevertheless the number of appreciation increased in geometric series. The combination of humour and emotional lyrics with an excellent musical illustration makes the album easier for listening and understanding of a much wider auditory. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%87%D0%B8%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The Brooklyn native made his first recorded appearances on records by such Wu side projects and solo albums as the Gravediggaz, Ol' Dirty Bastard's Return to the 36 Chambers, and, most importantly, Genius\/GZA's seminal Liquid Swords. His contributions became legendary and paved the way for the release of his acclaimed debut album, Heavy Mental, in the spring of 1998.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York and raised in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville, Killah Priest became infatuated with hip-hop as a child, listening to old-school and new school acts like Eric B. & Rakim alike. He also was influenced by local rappers, like GZA and Onyx's Suave, who would often play local parties. Killah Priest began working on his rhyming and eventually earned a considerable reputation in Brooklyn , but instead of pursuing his musical career further, he took a sabbatical in order to educate himself, primarily about religion and history.\n\nKillah Priest returned to rapping in 1995, appearing on several Wu projects. All of his cameos were noteworthy, but his role on Liquid Swords earned special attention. By the end of 1996, he formed his own side project, the Sunz of Man. In 1997, GZA suggested to Geffen that they sign Killah Priest, and the label took his advice.\n\nKillah worked on the album with True Master and 4th Disciple, two producers associated with the Clan. The resulting album, Heavy Mental, was dense with religious imagery and filled with evocative sounds. It received excellent reviews upon its March 1998 release and was a respectable commercial success, debuting at number 24 on the pop charts.\n\nKillah Priest issued his second album, View from Masada, in the spring of 2000, further bolstering his status as one of the most compelling solo artists in the Wu-Tang stable. After that he has released more projects such as Priesthood and Black August. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Killah+Priest\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Originally known as Derek X, Sadat takes his name from former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat. The X is taken from the Nation of Islam practice of members changing their surnames simply to X. He is well known for his unique, high-pitched voice, as well as his Pro-Black, and at times controversial, lyrical content.\n\nSadat X debuted with Brand Nubian in 1989, with the release of their debut single Brand Nubian b\/w Feels So Good. The group's debut album, One For All, was released in late 1990, featuring the singles All For One, Wake Up and Slow Down. The album was widely acclaimed, inspired by the teachings of the Nation of Islam, similar to many groups of the era, including X-Clan, Public Enemy and Poor Righteous Teachers. One For All is now considered a classic hip hop album, and was awarded a 5 Mic rating from popular magazine The Source. Brand Nubian returned in 1993 with the album In God We Trust, which featured the hit single  Punks Jump Up To Get Beat Down. Sadat received a bit of controversy following the song's release, due to alleged homophobic content. Following the mixed reviews from the group's third album, 1994's Everything is Everything, Brand Nubian split up to pursue solo endeavors. In 1996, Sadat released his first solo effort, Wild Cowboys. The album featured production from Pete Rock, Da Beatminerz, Diamond D, Showbiz and Buckwild, as well as a pair of hit singles, Hang 'Em High and The Lump Lump, the former charting on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadat reunited with original Brand Nubian members Grand Puba, Lord Jamar and DJ Alamo for a reunion album, Foundation, released in late 1998.

He was a co-founder of the indie hip hop record label Anticon.\n\nWhitney was born in Portland, Maine to a jazz drummer and a church organist, grew up in a suburb called Hollis and played drums in his high school band. Isolated in a small town, alias found no music that captivated him until at age 13 when he saw \"Yo MTV Raps.\" Alone in his interest in hiphop, alias sought to immerse himself in this foreign counter-culture. He bought The Source monthly at the one shop in Maine that carried it, and by age 14 he was writing his own raps. In support of his new found passion, his parents bought him a drum machine for Christmas, and alias rapped over his own beats in the privacy of his bedroom, too shy to share his rhymes with anyone. \n\nHowever, in 1993, upon meeting Sole, who was already recording and doing shows, alias began rapping in ciphers at parties. He moved his \"studio\" from his bedroom to a friend's basement where he taught himself to use an MPC 3000 and an ADAT machine. In '96 he started doing shows with The Live Poets (sole's group) around New England.\n\nIn '98 during the deep puddle dynamics sessions in Minneapolis with Slug, dose and sole, alias realized that music would be his life's work. Now taking himself seriously as a rapper and producer, he moved with the first wave of the anticon West Coast migration into a warehouse in East Oakland with his wife Jen and sole. Within a year he had recorded the other side of the looking glass, his first solo release, a rap-heavy introspective opus. alias found himself drawn more towards production while working on tracks for sole's selling live water album, and in 2002-03 he recorded his first instrumental project, the eyes closed ep (out now) which anticipates the upcoming muted full-length (oct 2003).\n\nAlias has collaborated with every member of the anticon roster, Slug of Atmosphere, Sage Francis, DJ Krush, and Markus Acher of the Notwist. He has toured the world, performing with such acts as The Roots, Dalek, Freestyle Fellowship, and Kid 606. \n\n3) Alias was A UK grime and dark garage producer.\n\n4) Alias was a Southern Rock band featuring members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Rossington Collins Band.  They released the album Contraband in 1979.\n\n5) Alias was a traditional metal band from Sarasota, Florida. Formed in 1985 and released their self titled debut in 1987 and the follower Metal to Infinity two years later. \n\n6) Alias is American action television series created by J. J. Abrams which was broadcast on ABC for five seasons, from September 30, 2001 to May 22, 2006. It starred Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow, a CIA agent.\n\nThe main theme of the series explores Sydney's obligation to conceal her true career from her friends and family, even as she assumes multiple aliases to carry out her missions. These themes are most prevalent in the first two seasons of the show. A major plotline of the series was the search for and recovery of artifacts created by Milo Rambaldi, a fictional Leonardo da Vinci-like inventor and Nostradamus-like prophet from the Renaissance period. This plot and some technologies used in the series pushed Alias into the genre of science fiction.\n\n7) Alias is a Scottish Techno duo formed by  Harvey McKay and  Ryan McKay.

Her music style could be described in the United States mostly as \"pop\". Most of her music is in Spanish, although a few tracks on each album were recorded in English. Although her albums are not readily available in the US record shelves as they are in Spain, they can be found on the Internet.\n\nChenoa was born in Mar de Plata (Argentina) on June 25, 1975, although her family moved to Spain when she was 8. Her parents were both musicians and they used to work in hotels as singers in live music shows, so Chenoa has lived and breathed music since birth.\n\nAt the age of 16, Chenoa began to sing professionally taking part in her parent's show. Her mother fell ill and Chenoa had to stand in for her.\n\nShe graduated as a teacher in nursery school, and started performing in the Casino de Mallorca shows when she was 20. There, Chenoa acquired a good stage presence before entering the first edition of the Spanish TV show Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo in 2001.\n\nHer first album was \u201cChenoa\u201d, released in April 2002 in Spain. The first single was Atr\u00e9vete, a song whose English version is also included in the album as Mystify, but the greatest hit of this CD was Cuando tu vas, danced all over Spain in the summer of '02. \u201cChenoa\u201d sold over 500,000 copies in Spain after 61 weeks in Top 100 chart, and she was nominated for the Spanish music industry awards Premios Amigo as best female new artist, and best female artist. Year 2002 finished with a Spanish tour that included more than 70 dates.\n\nIn April 2003 Chenoa took part in Eurobest, an European song contest in which she performed \"It's raining men\u201d. Her great stage presence led her to victory.\n\nThe unplugged album \u201cMis canciones favoritas\u201d was Chenoa\u2019s second CD. It was recorded in Barcelona in April 2003, and included some of her favorite songs, such as: Man in the mirror, Respect, Chain of fools or Love of my life. This CD+DVD was released on a limited edition of 100,000 copies for fans.\n\n\u201cSoy Mujer\u201d was the chosen title for her second studio album, recorded in Miami and Madrid in 2003. Pop, rock, and latin, arab and anglosaxon sounds are mixed in this CD, which reached number one in the Spanish album chart, and sold more than 230,000 copies after 47 weeks in the Top 100. \"En tu cruz me clavaste\", \"Soy lo que me das\", \"Siete P\u00e9talos\", \"Dame and Soy Mujer were the singles released. Chenoa was nominated again for the Premios Amigo award as best female artist and completed an 80-date tour in Spain. In 2004 she was nominated for the Tu M\u00fasica award as best new artist, in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn May and June 2004 she started \u201cSoy Mujer\u201d promotional tour around Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Argentina. In December she visited Panama, Costa Rica and Dominican Republic.\n\nIn April 2005 the Spanish Radio and Television Associations Federation awarded her the Micr\u00f3fono de Oro 2005. Venezuela has also awarded Chenoa in 2005 with the Mara de Oro 2005 to the best new international artist of the year.\n\nNovember was the month chosen for the release of Chenoa's third studio album \"Nada es igual\". In this pop-rock CD we find a new direction in Chenoa\u2019s music, as it has been produced by Dado Parisini (Laura Pausini, Nek, Tears for Fears), and recorded in Milan. \u201cNada es igual\" it's not only a sample of her musical evolution, but also of her new personal challenge. Rutinas is the first single.\n\nChenoa has still been going strong in the Spanish Charts, although most other reality TV show stars die out soon after. In 2004, her song Dame topped the Spanish charts for three weeks. In 2005, her song Rutinas (Routines) from her new album released in Nov 2005 reached number 4 on its first week, which is a great achievement.\n\nAlbums\n2002 Chenoa - #1 SP \n2003 Mis Canciones Favoritas (Unplugged Album) - #10 SP \n2003 Soy Mujer - #1 SP \n2005 Nada Es Igual - #3 SP \n\nSingles\n2002 \"Atr\u00e9vete (Mystify)\" - #1 SP \n2002 \"Cuando Tu Vas\" - #1 SP \n2002 \"Yo Te Dar\u00e9\" \n2003 \"El Centro De Mi Amor\" - #1 SP \n2003 \"Desnuda Frente A T\u00ed\" - #5 SP \n2003 \"En Tu Cruz Me Clavaste\" - #1 SP \n2004 \"Soy Lo Que Me Das\" - #2 SP \n2004 \"Siete P\u00e9talos\" - #2 SP \n2004 \"Dame\" - #1 SP \n2004 \"Soy Mujer\" \n2005 \"Rutinas\" - #1 SP \n2006 \"Tengo Para Ti\" \u2014 #5 SP \n2006 \"Donde Est\u00e9s...\" \u2014 release October  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Chenoa\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

His musical touch has influenced Indonesian pop music. His lyrics are made by himself, he never collaborates with other musicians to arrange the lyrics, but he can collaborate with them to arrange his musical arrangement.\n\nBorn as Abdul Gafar Abdullah in Wonodadi, Banjarnegara; he is the youngest son of Aboe Ja'far. He had many desires: engineer, doctor, and painter. But as it turned out, eventually he became a famous singer, although he only wants to be called a poeter.\n\nIn 1970s, Ebiet was close to Yogyakarta young artist society. It formed his musical style. Close to a prolific artist Emha Ainun Nadjib, he often sang his friend\u2019s poems with his guitar. But, when entering recording studio, he did not sing any of Emha\u2019s songs. Although Ebiet felt sorry to leave Yogyakarta, he concentrated to try his luck and natural talent in Jakarta. The recording of his songs were successful. He recorded in the Philippines to get the better recording. But he refused to record his songs in Japanese, when he had a chance to have a concert there.\n\nMarried with Yayuk Sugianto (Iis Sugianto\u2019s old sister), in 1982; he has 4 sons: Abietyasakti Ksatria Kinasih, Adaprabu Hantip Trengginas, Byatuasa Pakarti Hinuwih, and Segara Banyu Bening. They lived in Ciganjur, Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta. In his house Ebiet raises about 20 birds.\n\nLater, he recorded in Colombia Record, the United States. Ebiet also involved Adie MS and Jimmy Manoppo to assist his music.\n\nEbiet was chosen as the favorite singer of ABRI Radio Broadcasting (1989-1992), BASF Awards winner 1984 until 1988, and the best singer in 1997 Indonesian Musical Awards.\n\nUntil 1990, he has launched 12 albums, Camellia I (1979), Camellia II (1979), Camellia III (1980), Camellia IV (1980), Langkah Berikutnya (1982), Tokoh-Tokoh (1982), 1984 (1984), Zaman (1985), Isyu! (1986), Menjaring Matahari (1987), Sketsa Rembulan Emas (1988), and Seraut Wajah (1990). But Ebiet \"went to seclusion\" for the next 5 years. In 1995, the albums he launched were Kupu-Kupu Kertas and Cinta Sebening Embun. In 1996, Ebiet launched Aku Ingin Pulang. Kupu-Kupu Kertas was supported by musicians such as Ian Antono, Billy J. Budiardjo, Purwacaraka, and Erwin Gutawa.\n\nIn the following years, Ebiet launched 3 albums, Gamelan (1998), Balada Sinetron Cinta (2000), and Bahasa Langit (2001). Again, he secluded for 5 years, but he once appeared in the collaboration album Kita Untuk Mereka (2004).\n\nIn 2007, he launched a new album, In Love: 25th Anniversary, to commemorate his 25-year marriage. All of its songs are about love. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ebiet+G.+Ade\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

However, although Peter Coyle (vocals), Jeremy Kelly (guitar), Mike Dempsey (bass guitar), Ged Quinn (keyboard) and Stephen Creese (drums) had the elegant attire, and fashionable haircuts of new romantic bands, their music was more understated and folksy than the synthesized Euro-disco of Japan, Visage and Duran Duran. The Lotus Eaters toured extensively throughout Japan, despite arguments with their record label there.\n\nIn 1998, The First Picture of You, a compilation of the Lotus Eaters' BBC Radio 1 sessions, was released, and the No Sense of Sin album was reissued on CD with bonus tracks.\n\nIn 2002, The Lotus Eaters, reduced to the duo of Coyle and Kelly reformed after almost two decades, to record a new album, entitled Silent Space.\n\nIn April 2009, the band (composed of Coyle, Kelly and Stephen Emmer) announced on their MySpace page that they were working, with producer Steve Power, on material for a new album, to be called A Plug-In Called Nostalgia.\n\nIn March 2009 The band announced a one-off concert to be held at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on 25 July. The gig, a performance of the album No Sense of Sin, is to feature the trio accompanied by a string string quartet from the University of Huddersfield.\n\nIn late 2017 No Sense Of Sin was re-released, a 2 LP Deluxe Hardback Book Edition, featuring the original album and a bonus 5 track disc including 12inch versions of the singles not on the original album. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Lotus+Eaters\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Kleiton fez curso de Ma\u00eetrise pela Universidade Paris VIII, da Fran\u00e7a, Mestrado em M\u00fasica Eletroac\u00fastica pela UFRJ e exerceu a atividade acad\u00eamica como professor da Escola de M\u00fasica da UFRJ.\nEm 1975, com mais 3 amigos, lan\u00e7aram \u201cAlm\u00f4ndegas\u201d, a banda que foi um marco na hist\u00f3ria da m\u00fasica popular do Rio Grande.

Foram 5 discos (mais 1 em espanhol) o que lhes rendeu disco de ouro e shows por USA, Europa e Am\u00e9rica Latina. Gravaram em Los Angeles, New York, Lisboa, Paris, Miami e Buenos Aires. Suas composi\u00e7\u00f5es foram gravadas por Simone, Nara Le\u00e3o, MPB4, Caetano Veloso, Xuxa, Faf\u00e1 de Bel\u00e9m, Nenhum de N\u00f3s, Zizi Possi, Ivan Lins, Chit\u00e3ozinho e Xoror\u00f3, Zez\u00e9 de Camargo e Luciano, Leonardo, Fat Family, Emilio Santiago e muitos outros. Tamb\u00e9m pelo mundo afora suas m\u00fasicas ganharam vers\u00f5es de grandes artistas, como os argentinos Mercedes Sosa e Fito Paez e a cantora portuguesa Eugenia Mello e Castro.\n \tKleiton & Kledir trouxeram definitivamente para a cultura popular brasileira a nova m\u00fasica ga\u00facha. Eternizaram um sotaque diferente e uma outra maneira de falar e cantar, com termos at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o desconhecidos como \u201cDeu pra ti\u201d, \u201cTri legal\u201d, etc. Esse jeito diferente de ser e fazer as coisas transformou K&K numa refer\u00eancia fundamental para quem quer entender a m\u00fasica brasileira do nosso tempo. Acabaram se transformando em s\u00edmbolos do ga\u00facho contempor\u00e2neo, do homem moderno do sul do Brasil, o que fez com que o Governo do Estado lhes conferisse o t\u00edtulo de \u201cEmbaixadores Culturais do Rio Grande do Sul\u201d.\nMas apesar de tanto sucesso a dupla resolveu se separar. Kleiton foi viver na Fran\u00e7a, Kledir ficou no Rio. Gravaram discos solo, fizeram outros projetos e produ\u00e7\u00f5es. Mas a saudade bateu e eles voltaram, depois de \u201cumas f\u00e9rias de 7 anos\u201d. E parece que n\u00e3o apenas eles estavam com saudade um do outro. O p\u00fablico tamb\u00e9m esperava essa volta.\nDesde que retornaram, K&K gravaram os CDs \u201cDOIS\u201d (Som Livre) e \u201cSUL\u201d (Universal) e lan\u00e7aram colet\u00e2neas que venderam \u00bd milh\u00e3o de c\u00f3pias.

Estiveram em Paris onde apresentaram uma s\u00e9rie de 6 shows no Museu do Louvre e estiveram em tourn\u00e9e 2 vezes pelos EUA.\nNo carnaval carioca de 2002 foram homenageados pela Escola de Samba Caprichosos de Pilares, que desfilou com um enredo inspirado na m\u00fasica \u201cDeu pra ti\u201d. \nRecentemente apresentaram um espet\u00e1culo na \u00d3pera de Arame, em Curitiba, com a participa\u00e7\u00e3o de 20 corais, totalizando 500 vozes.

Born and raised in Saigon, South Vietnam, he came to the United States in 1994 where he first resettled in Connecticut.  Four years later, Nguyen Khang's name would first gain prominence in the overseas Vietnamese music industry after being discovered by singer Thuy Duong who had asked him to record the song, Em Ve Nao Co Hay, written by Hoang Trong Thuy on one of her albums.  Shortly after, Nguyen Khang began recording for World Music Productions that would release several of his solo studio albums in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Since then, he has made numerous appearances on video for Asia Entertainment and has earned a large fan base that consists of Vietnamese music lovers in all four corners of the world. \n\nWhen he first came onto the music scene, Nguyen Khang's voice was often compared to that of legendary singer Tuan Ngoc.  Nguyen Khang has disclosed on several interviews that indeed Tuan Ngoc has been his idol which could possibly explain the similarities in their voices.  However, through the years Nguyen Khang has definitely developed a style and sound of his own.  Among Nguyen Khang's most popular hit songs have included Anh Con Yeu Em, Cung La Tram Nam, Rong Reu, Vi Do La Em and Mai Toi Di, a duet he had recorded with singer Diem Lien.  Aside from his audio recordings, music video appearances and performances at live shows for Vietnamese audiences all over the world, Nguyen Khang can be seen on SET-TV as a news anchor alongside other singers Diem Lien and My Huyen.\n\nOn December of 2010, Nguyen Khang married actress Lam Bao Nhu.

Born as Pham Ngoc Phuong in Binh Duong, Elvis Phuong was educated in Saigon at a French Catholic school.  His first public performance was in 1962 when he performed at Regina Pacis High School Auditorium.  Due to his deep admiration of international rock and roll singer, Elvis Presley, he decided on the professional stage name of Elvis Phuong.  During the 1960s, Elvis Phuong took part in joining several pop music bands in Saigon like Rockin' Stars, Les Vampires, and Phuong Hoang.  Among his trademarks included his exceptional ability to sing in the French language.  His duets with Thanh Lan covering popular French love songs were widely received by audiences in South Vietnam prior to 1975.\n\nAfter the Fall of Saigon, Elvis Phuong left Vietnam for France.  After several years in France, he relocated to the United States.  Elvis Phuong was one of the first overseas Vietnamese singers to be able to continue his professional singing career successfully outside of Vietnam.  During the 1980s, Elvis Phuong produced a series of successful albums such as Tinh Ca Cho Em (1986), Vet Thu Tren Lung Ngua Hoang (1987), Lady Nguoi Toi Yeu (1988) and Tinh Muon (1989).  He had also co-produced a highly successful duet album together with singer Khanh Ly in 1985, Niem Khuc Cuoi.  In the early 1990s, Elvis Phuong gained a new following of fans with his duets recorded with Ai Van of Vietnamese folk music for Thuy Nga Paris, songs in which the pair would also perform on Paris By Night.  In 1996, Elvis Phuong released his solo autobiographical music videotape, Ta On Doi, Ta On Nguoi, which was filmed entirely in Vietnam.  The videotape was distributed by Kim Loi Productions and turned out to be one of the bestselling overseas Vietnamese music videotapes of the year.\n\nAmong his most popular songs include Muoi Nam Yeu Em, Dan Ba, Muoi Nam Tinh Cu, Tinh Cho Khong (L'amour C'est Pour Rien), and Goi Ten Nguoi Quen (Aline). \n\nAfter surviving open heart surgery in 1998, Elvis Phuong and his second wife decided to move back to Vietnam.  He now makes his home in Ho Chi Minh City.  His first marriage tragically ended in the early 1970s when his wife was killed in an automobile accident in Saigon.  In the 1980s, he was in a long term relationship with Cat Phuong, film actress and principal dancer of the legendary Luu Hong Dance Troupe which performed at Maxim's back in Saigon prior to 1975.  On May 10, 2014, he celebrated his 54th year in show business in a sold out live concert show held at Lan Anh Music Venue in Ho Chi Minh City.  Among the featured guest performers that night included Dam Vinh Hung, Duong Trieu Vu, Pham Anh Khoa, Le Hieu and Nguyen Anh 9.  Elvis Phuong has a younger sister, Kieu Nga, and a son from his first marriage, Phuong Hung, who are both established overseas Vietnamese singers. \n\nElvis Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng, real name Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u1ecdc Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng (born Th\u1ee7 D\u1ea7u M\u1ed9t 1945) is a Vietnamese popular singer. To the Vietnamese-American community, and to many other Vietnamese all over the world, he is our own male superstar of the Vietnamese music industry.\n\nLoved music since he was 6 years of age, Elvis learned to sing by listening to the records or tapes of foreign singers, especially Elvis Presley. When he was 17 or 18 years old, against his father wishes, Elvis Phuong chose to stay in Viet Nam to pursue a career in singing instead of going to France for an education. Elvis Phuong, whose real name is Pham Ngoc Phuong selected his stage name after his idol, Elvis Presley.\n\nHis first appearance in front of an audience was in 1962 at Regina Pacis high school's open house where he sang Nua dem ngoai pho and O' Cangaceiro. The first band that he worked with was the Rockin' Stars, a popular band during the early 60s. In subsequent years, he also collaborated with other famous bands such as Les Vampires and Phuong Hoang. In 1968, Mr Ngoc Chanh of Shotguns Productions produced Elvis Phuong's first album titled Shotguns 26: Tieng Hat Elvis Phuong. In 1977, Elvis Phuong's musical journey took him by storm with the first album produced overseas titled Hat Cho Nguoi Vuot Bien. Since then, Elvis Phuong has recorded many tapes and\/or CDs and appeared in many videos.\n\nElvis Phuong is a strong and surprisingly versatile singer. He covers a wide range of styles such as Rock n' Roll, Pop, Folk, Pre-War, Post-War, Ballad etc. His name is associated with hits such as Vet Thu Tren Lung Ngua Hoang, Ao Em Sut Chi Duong Ta, Dan Ba, Dem Nho Ve SaiGon etc.\n\nAs described in a press release, his latest work Ta On Doi - Ta On Nguoi was made in Viet Nam to portray his 35 years career as a singer. His diversified talent is manifested on this video, a collection of gems that were displayed through the lyrical and musical terrain of Rock'n'Roll (Blue Suede Shoes), Folks (Tat Nuoc Dau Dinh, Qua Cau Gio Bay), and Romantic Ballads - in Vietnamese, English and French (Thuong Nhau Ngay Mua, Giot Nang Ben Them, Unchained Melody, Aline, Ma Vie etc.). All of the songs were skillfully mixed by either Manh Trinh or Billy Shane or Chi Tai or Bill Kilpatrick except for one, \"Yeu Nguoi Va Yeu Doi.\" Here, the listeners witness Elvis Phuong's talent, and without any high tech or fancy mixing, just his powerful and filled with emotion tone of voice, accompanied by the guitar of Le Huu Ha.\n\nElvis Phuong, says, \"I chose the name of the video Ta On Doi - Ta On Nguoi to show my appreciation of what I have today. I would not be where I am today without the love and support of my colleagues and my fans.\" Elvis Phuong, his wife, Phan Le Hoa and the crew from Kim Loi Productions, traveled throughout the North, Central and South Viet Nam to locate the appropriate scenes for this video.\n\nLiving for Elvis Phuong means knowing to enjoy life to the fullest. His secrets to a happy marriage are trust, love, honesty, and loyalty. Elvis Phuong and his wife, Phan Le Hoa, established their own company, EP Productions in Cerritos, Southern California. Born in Binh Duong, Elvis Phuong is an Aquarius and celebrates his birthday on February 1st.

Aside from his work with his own material, Charry has also composed music for various small budget films, commercials, and theater productions. \n\nCharry is a former member of \"Oui Oui,\" a French pop group formed in 1983. Guitarist\/singer \u00c9tienne Charry and drummer Michel Gondry met at secondary school in S\u00e8vres in 1978. The repertoire of songs Oui Oui built up was a reaction to what was termed cold wave music in France and the more politicised rock groups of the era. Numerous musicians passed through the group's ranks in the early years. With the addition of keyboardist Gilles Chapat and bassist Nicolas Dufournet, a more settled line-up was established.\n\nIn 1989 Oui Oui released their first album Chacun Tout Le Monde on the Just'in label. Following the departure of Gilles Chapat, the second Oui Oui album Formidable (1991, released by FNAC Music) was recorded by the trio of Charry, Gondry and Dufournet. Keyboardist Matthieu Ballet would later take Chapat's place. Both Oui Oui albums are currently out of print, having been issued by labels which would cease operations within months of the respective albums' releases.\n\nOui Oui disbanded in 1992. Michel Gondry has since gone on to become an acclaimed movie and music video director. The film clips he directed for Oui Oui would later feature on the 2003 DVD The Work of Michel Gondry. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Etienne+Charry\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Thanh Tuy\u1ec1n's famous sibling is S\u01a1n Tuy\u1ec1n. She is also Shayla's mom. In 1979, Thanh Tuy\u1ec1n's family came to the United States and settled in Washington and then Houston, Texas.\n\nAs a child, Thanh Tuy\u1ec1n demonstrated a nack for singing and performance. At the age of five, against the wishes of her parents, she studied music with an uncle. Consequently, she was often disciplined for being so defiant. She later studied music under Mr. M\u1ea1nh Ph\u00e1t. She first sang publicly at Th\u00f4ng Nh\u1ea5t Theater in Saigon at the age of 7. She received many praises for this performance and the newspapers at the time gave her the title, \"Nh\u01b0 Mai The Prodigy\".

The band formed in 1988 and has since recorded 10 albums, nine of which are on Rounder Records.\n\nThe bands members include: Steve Riley (accordion), David Greely (fiddle), Sam Broussard (guitar), Brazos Huval (fiddle\/saxophone\/bass) and Kevin Dugas (drums).\n\nAn additional member, Jimmy Domengeaux played guitar with the band up until his death in 1999. Domengeaux was killed in a motorcycle accident in southwestern Louisiana.\n\nAlthough the band plays primarily Cajun music, other forms are blended into the music. The mood of the Bayou Ruler album (produced by C. C. Adcock and Tarka Cordell) is a bit edgier than its other albums. This emotional quality seems to reveal a level of comfort with the music that far surpassed the bands other albums.\n\nOn their latest album Dominos they have two excellent medleys \"Napoleon B. Fruge\" and the \"Ardoin Medley\". Their timing seems quite precise and allows the band to do interesting effects such as they do when they overlay parts on the fiddle on the song \"Creole Stomp\" on the Happy Town album.\n\nThe addition of Sam Broussard on guitar five years ago added an extra dimension to their music. Steve has his own blend of precision and speed on the accordion which sets him apart from many Cajun accordion players. David Greely the fiddle player finds old songs and poems and brings them to life. The vocal harmonies the Mamou Playboys do allows them to bring a new audience to traditional songs. Cajun music and Cajun dancing go hand and hand. They play a mixture of song types that are good for doing different kinds of dances. Some of the dances that suit their songs are waltz, cajun jig, swing, slow dance, two steps, and zydeco. Their albums cannot reveal the liveliness of their shows since the feedback from the audience and dancers affects the tone of the show. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Steve+Riley+&+The+Mamou+Playboys\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The other two brothers are Kamal Heer, with classical music training and the gift to lure live audiences, and the third brother is music writer and director - Sangtar.  Manmohan Waris is one of the top Punjabi singers in the world. He has been around for almost 12 years now. Since he released his first album \"Gairan Naal Peenghan Jhootdeye' in 1993, he has never looked back. Punjabis around the world love him and he feels the pressure of not letting them down. His humbleness and sincerity has won many hearts. His voice is considered one of the sweetest around and his songs attest to his passion for clean and literary lyrics. So far Waris has released 17 albums which are:\n\n      1.  Gairan Naal Peenghan Jhootdeye\n      2.  Sohnian De Laaray\n      3.  Hasdi De Ful Kirde\n      4.  Sajjre Challe Muklavay\n      5.  Gali Gali Vich Hokay\n      6.  Chardi Kala Ch Panth Khalsa\n      7.  Mitran Da Sah Rukda\n      8.  Husn Da Jadu\n      9.  Gajray Gori De\n      10. Dil Vatte Dil\n      11. Ghar Hun Kitni ku Doore\n      12. Nachiye Majajne\n      13. Punjabi Virsa 2004 (along with Kamal Heer)  \n      14. Punjabi Virsa 2005 (along with Kamal Heer)  \n      15. Tasveer Live\n      16. Punjabi Virsa 2006 (along with Kamal Heer)\n      17. Dil Nachda\n\n                            He was born into a farming family in the Village of Halluwal, Punjab. He had a great interest in music since an early age. He started his formal music training at the age of 11. Everything he learned from his Guru, he taught his younger brothers. So all three brothers got seriously involved in music at a very early age.\n\nHe got his music degree from Punjab University. But the most influential music Guru he had was Shree Jaswant Singh Bhanwra. Unlike many other Punjabi singers who also learned music from Shree Jaswant Singh Bhnawra, the Guru did not teach him so called \"Lok-Gaayiki\", he insisted on teaching him the real music he knew himself. He saw a great singer in Manmohan and he wanted him to shine.\n\nIn 1990, Manmohan Waris's family moved to Canada. Here he made his first album 'Gairan Naal Peenghan Jhootdeye.' The album was a great success and when Waris returned to Punjab, Punjabi's everywhere just couldn't get enough of him. So he decided to move back to India.\n\nHis career has never seen a foggy day since that time. Waris' philosophy about his name and fame may have something to do with that. In his opinion \"keeping your name on the top is not an easy thing, you have to work hard to get here, and you have to work harder to stay here\".\n\nManmohan got married in 1996 and in 1997 he and his wife Pritpal had their first baby. It was a boy and they named him 'Amar' after the great Punjabi Dhadi singer 'Amar Singh Shaunki. Manmohan's in-laws are also from the same village as the late Dhadi. Waris has recorded a few of Dhadi Amar Singh Shaunki's songs as a tribute to him. These songs are:\n\n      1. Do Tara Vajda Ve (1993)\n      2. Aja Bhabi Jhoot Le (2000)\n      3. Ghar Hun Kitni Ku Doore (2003)\n\n             Manmohan's latest religious release, named \u201cTasveer\u201d contains 9 very touching and thoughtful songs. In 2001 Manmohan and his wife had their second child, a girl named 'Saiya'. Manmohan spends most of the year in Punjab and he tours the west in the summer.\n\n                               Manmohan's songs are evergreen songs. People remember his earliest work same way as they do his latest. Manmohan's  latest Punjabi Album is titled \"Nachiye Majajne\". The album is on Plasma Records\/Kiss records and got a great response from Punjabis everywhere. The title song \"Aja Appan Nachiye Majajne\" with its Desi music and Dhole rhythms is a milestone on the future path of Punjabi music. Also the success of 'Punjabi Virsa.' another song from this album proves that there is still room for literary and meaningful poetry in the fast paced, single based commercial Punjabi music world.\n\nWaris has always worked hard to put his efforts where his heart is. He is always eager to point out anything that gets his attention. He has never sung a song to gain mere a commercial success. But this is not his greatness, his greatness is that he doesn't do it to serve his language or his native land, he just does it because he is that kind of person and it is his nature.\n\nWe hope that Waris will continue to give us thoughtful and yet entertaining music for many years to come and may God help him to live his dreams.\nSwaran Shergill @ punjaab.com\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Manmohan+Waris\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

But acting as a female musician in the public has never lost its connotation of indecency in Sudanesean society. Setona lived with her family in the Sudanese capital Khartoum in a quarter inhabitating people from different Central African countries as Nigeria, Zaire, Ethiopia and people from the southern parts of Sudan. \n\nTogether with her husband Ahmed, who has been working as a teacher and collecting music all over the vast country, she draws from a broad spectrum of African rhythms and melodies. \nIn her music Setona combines with ease influences of all those peoples living alongside the tarig as-sudan as an unique crossroad of cultures. One will find musical influences from areas being as too dispersed as East Africa (Taraab), Zaire (Soukous), Ghana (Highlife), Nigeria (JuJu, Fuji) and Sierra Leone (Palmwine music) and furthermore Uganda, Ethiopia, Tchad, Senegal, Nubia, Egypt and and and ... - apparently pan African music and truely Sudanese at the same time. \n\nShe creates a musical mix that has never been done by any other Sudanesean artist. One shouldn't be surprised to find within Setona's repertoire songs from countries in Western and Eastern Africa she has never been to. But the greatest \"hits\" have been kept within the peoples' memories for centuries and as a result Setona sometimes performs in languages (or fragments of languages) she doesn't really understand. \n\nIn all countries of the Orient women share a life sphere of its own which is filled up with lots of songs. Within this sphere that is hardly noticed by male visitors from abroad Setona learned how to work the typical Henna tattoes without whom no traditional wedding would be complete. And she was trained in specific African kinds of female healthcare as vapour-baths and burning incences. In Cairo today she is the so called \"Queen of Henna\".\n\nSince a couple of years Setona lives with her husband Ahmed in Cairo, where she has established herself as a wanted \"wedding-consultant\" for traditional wedding ceremonies. She takes care about the young women expecting their wedding, prepares special wedding food and teaches the old songs that women sing during the wedding ceremony - in this way she keeps alive tradition in a changing world. With her music that is released on this album for the first time Setona wants to evoke mutual understanding and togetherness of different cultures within her native country - and beyond.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Setona\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He scored for the films Zorba the Greek (1964), Z (1969), and Serpico (1973). He is viewed as Greece's best-known living composer.\n\nPolitically, he identified with the left until the late 1980s; in 1989 he ran as an independent candidate within the centre-right New Democracy party in order for the country to come out of the political crisis that had been created due to the numerous scandals of the government of Andreas Papandreou and helped to establish a large coalition between conservatives, socialists and leftists. In 1990 he was elected to the parliament (as in 1964 and 1981), became a government minister under Constantine Mitsotakis, and fought against drugs and terrorism and for culture, education and better relations between Greece and Turkey. He continues to speak out in favor of left-liberal causes, Greek-Turkish-Cypriot relations, and against the War in Iraq. He has consistently opposed oppressive regimes and was a key voice against the Greek junta 1967-1974, which imprisoned him.\n\nBiography\nEarly years\nMikis Theodorakis was born on the Greek island of Chios and spent his childhood years in different provincial Greek cities such as Mytilene, Cephallonia, Patras, Pyrgos, and Tripoli. His father, a lawyer and a civil servant, was from the small village of Kato Galatas, in Crete and his mother, Aspasia Poulakis, was from an ethnically Greek family in \u00c7e\u015fme, in what is today Turkey. He was raised with Greek folk music and was influenced by Byzantine liturgy; as a child he had already talked about becoming a composer. Theodorakis's fascination with music began in early childhood; he taught himself to write his first songs without access to musical instruments. In Patras and Pyrgos he took his first music lessons, and in Tripoli, Peloponnese, he gave his first concert at the age of seventeen.\n\nHe went to Athens in 1943, and became a member of a Reserve Unit of ELAS, and led a troop in the fight against the British and the Greek right in the Dekemvriana. During the Greek Civil War he was arrested, sent into exile on the island of Icaria and then deported to the island of Makronisos, where he was tortured and twice buried alive.\n\nDuring the periods when he was not obliged to hide, not exiled or jailed, he studied from 1943 to 1950 at the Athens Conservatoire under Filoktitis Economidis. In 1950, he finished his studies and took his last two exams \"with flying colours\". He went to Crete, where he became the \"head of the Chania Music School\" and founded his first orchestra. At this time he ended what he has called the first period of his musical writing.\n\nStudies in Paris\nIn 1954 he travelled with his young wife Myrto Altinoglou to Paris where he entered the Conservatory and studied musical analysis under Olivier Messiaen and conducting under Eugene Bigot. His time in Paris, 1954\u20131959, was his second period of musical writing.\n\nHis symphonic works: a Piano concerto, his first suite, his first symphony, and his scores for the ballet: Greek Carnival, Le Feu aux Poudres, Les Amants de Teruel, received international acclaim. In 1957, he won the Gold Medal in the Moscow Music Festival; President of the Jury was Dmitri Shostakovitch. In 1959, after the successful performances of Theodorakis's ballet Antigone at Covent Garden in London, the French composer Darius Milhaud proposed him for the American Copley Music Prize - an award of the \"William and Noma Copley Foundation\", which later changed its name to \"Cassandra Foundation\" - as the \"Best European Composer of the Year\". His first international scores for the film Ill Met by Moonlight and Luna de Miel, directors: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, were also very successful: The Honeymoon title song became part of the repertoire of The Beatles.\n\nNotable works up to 1960\nChamber Music: Four String Quartets; Trio four piano, violin, cello; Little Suite for piano; Sonatina for piano; Sonatinas No.1 and No.2 for violin and piano;\nSymphonic music: Assi-Gonia (symphonic movement; Piano Concerto \"Helicon\"; Symphony No.1 (Proti Simfonia); Suites n\u00b0 1, 2 et 3 for orchestre; La Vie et la Mort \/ Live and Death (for voice and strings); \u0152dipus Tyrannos (for strings; later for quartet and symphony orchestra); Piano Concerto;\nBallets: Greek Carnival; Le Feu aux Poudres; Les Amants de Teruel; Antigone;\nFilmscores: The Barefoot Battalion (Greg Tallas); Ill Met by Moonlight and Honeymoon (Powell and Pressburger); Faces in the Dark (David Eady).\n\nBack to Greek roots\n\nMikis Theodorakis shortly after his return to Greece, 1961,with Nicholas G. Constantin, Athanasios G. Konstantinopoulos, and Bill Vanech on his right, in his club called MYRTIA\nIn 1960, Theodorakis returned to Greece and his roots in genuine Greek music: With his song cycle Epitaphios he started the third period of his composing and contributed to a cultural revolution in his country.[41] His most significant and influential works are based Greek and world poetry \u2013 Epiphania (Giorgos Seferis), Little Kyklades (Odysseas Elytis), Axion Esti (Odysseas Elytis), Mauthausen (Iakovos Kambanellis), Romiossini (Yannis Ritsos), and Romancero Gitano (Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca) \u2013 he attempted to give back to Greek music a dignity which in his perception it had lost. He developed his concept of \"metasymphonic music\" (symphonic compositions that go beyond the \"classical\" status and mix symphonic elements with popular songs, Western symphonic orchestra and Greek popular instruments).\n\nHe founded the Little Orchestra of Athens and the Musical Society of Piraeus, gave many, many concerts all around Greece and abroad... and he naturally became involved in the politics of his home country. After the assassination of Gregoris Lambrakis in May 1963 he founded the Lambrakis Democratic Youth (\"Lambrakid\u00e8s\") and was elected its president. Under Theodorakis's impetus, it started a vast cultural renaissance movement and became the greatest political organisation in Greece with more than 50.000 members.[43] Following the 1964 elections, Theodorakis became a member of the Greek Parliament, associated with the left-wing party EDA. Because of his political ideas, the composer was black-listed by the cultural establishment; at the time of his biggest artistic glory, a large number of his songs were censored-before-studio or were not allowed on the radio stations.\n\nDuring 1964, he wrote the music for the Michael Cacoyiannis film Zorba the Greek, whose main theme, since then, exists as a trademark for Greece. It is also known as 'Syrtaki dance'; inspired from old Cretan traditional dances.\n\nMain works of this period\nSong cycles: Epitaphios (Yannis Ritsos); Archipelagos (Songs of the Islands), Politia A & B (Songs of the City), Epiphania (Giorgos Seferis, Nobel Prize 1963), Mikres Kyklades (Odysseas Elytis), Chrysoprasino Fyllo (Golden-green leaf), Mauthausen (Iakovos Kambanellis), Romiossini (Yannis Ritsos), Thalassina Feggaria (Moons of the Sea)\nOratorio: To Axion Esti[45] (Odysseas Elytis, Nobel Prize 1979), cf. Theodorakis on Axion Esti[46]\nMusic for the Stage: The Hostage (Brendan Behan); Ballad of the Dead Brother (Theodorakis); Omorphi Poli (Beautiful City); Maghiki Poli (Magical City); I Gitonia ton Angelon(The Angels' Quarter, Iakovos Kambanellis)\nFilm scores: Phaedra (Jules Dassin), The Lovers of Teruel (Raymond Rouleau), Five Miles to Midnight (Anatole Litvak), Electra and Zorba the Greek (Michalis Cacoyannis), To Nisi tis Afroditis (Harilaos Papadopoulos)\n\nM. Theodorakis (1971)\nOn 21 April 1967 a right wing junta (the Regime of the Colonels) took power in a putsch. Theodorakis went underground and founded the \"Patriotic Front\" (PAM). On 1 June, the Colonels published \"Army decree No 13\", which banned playing, and even listening to his music. Theodorakis himself was arrested on 21 August,[47] and jailed for five months. Following his release end of January 1968, he was banished in August to Zatouna with his wife Myrto and their two children, Margarita and Yorgos.[48] Later he was interned in the concentration camp of Oropos.[49] An international solidarity movement, headed by such personalities as Dmitri Shostakovich, Leonard Bernstein, Arthur Miller, and Harry Belafonte demanded to get Theodorakis freed. On request of the French politician Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, Theodorakis was allowed to go into exile to Paris on 13 April 1970. Theodorakis's flight left very secretly from an Onassis owned private airport outside Athens. Theodorakis arrived at Le Bourget Airport where he met Costa Gavras, Melina Mercouri and Jules Dassin. Theodorakis was immediately hospitalized because he suffered from lung tuberculosis.[50] Myrto Theodorakis, Mikis's wife and two children joined him a week later in France. They arrived from Greece to France via Italy on a boat.\n\nMain works under the dictatorship\nSong cycles: Ta La\u00efka (The Popular Songs, Manos Elefteriou);[52] O Ilios ke o Chronos (Sun and Time, Theodorakis); Songs for Andreas (Theodorakis); Arcadies I-X; Nichta Thanatou (Nights of Death, Manos Elefteriou);\nOratorios: Ephiphania Averoff Giorgos Seferis, State of Siege (Marina = Rena Hadjidakis), March of the Spirit (Angelos Sikelianos), Raven (Giorgos Seferis, after Edgar Allan Poe);\nFilm score: Z (Costa-Gavras).\n\nResistance in exile\nWhile in exile, Theodorakis fought during four years for the overthrow of the colonels. He started his world tours and gave thousands of concerts on all continents as part of his struggle for the restoration of democracy in Greece.\n\nMikis Theodorakis at a concert in Caesarea, Israel, in the 1970s.\nHe met Pablo Neruda and Salvador Allende and promised them to compose his version of Neruda's Canto General. He was received by Gamal Abdel Nasser and Tito, Yigal Allon and Yasser Arafat, while Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand,[53] Olof Palme and Willy Brandt became his friends. For millions of people, Theodorakis was the symbol of resistance against the Greek dictatorship.\n\nMain works written in exile\n1. Song cycles: 18 lianotragouda tis pikris patridas (18 Short Songs of the Bitter Land, Yiannis Ritsos), Ballades (Manolis Anagnostakis), Tis exorias (Songs of the Exile)\n2. Oratorio: Canto General (Pablo Neruda)\n3. Film scores: The Trojan Women (M. Cacoyannis); State of Siege (Costa-Gavras); Serpico (Sidney Lumet)\n\nReturn to Greece\n\nTheodorakis on a visit in East Germany, May 1989.\nAfter the fall of the Colonels, Mikis Theodorakis returned to Greece on 24 July 1974 to continue his work and his concert tours, both in Greece and abroad.[55] At the same time he participated in public affairs. In 1978, through his article For a United Left Wing, he had \"stirred up the Greek political life. His proposal for the unification of the three parties of the former United Left \u2013 which had grown out of the National Liberation Front (N.L.F.) \u2013 had been accepted by the Greek Communist Party which later proposed him as the candidate for mayor of Athens during the 1978 elections.\" (Andreas Brandes) He was later elected several times to the Greek Parliament (1981\u20131986 and 1989\u20131993) and for two years, from 1990 to 1992, he was a minister in the government of Constantine Mitsotakis. After his resignation as a member of Greek parliament, he was appointed General Musical Director of the Choir and the two Orchestras of the Hellenic State Radio (ERT), which he reorganised and with which he undertook successful concert tours abroad.\n\nHe is committed to heightening international awareness of human rights, of environmental issues, and of the need for peace and for this reason he initiated, together with the Turkish author, musician, singer, and filmmaker Z\u00fclf\u00fc Livaneli the Greek\u2013Turkish Friendship Society.\n\nFrom 1981, Theodorakis had started the fourth period of his musical writing, during which he returned to the symphonic music, while still going on to compose song-cycles. His most significant works written in these years are his Second, Third, Fourth and Seventh Symphony, most of them being first performed in the former German Democratic Republic between 1982 and 1989. It was during this period that he received the Lenin Peace Prize. He composed his first opera Kostas Kariotakis (The Metamorphoses of Dionysus) and the ballet Zorba the Greek, premi\u00e8red in the Arena of Verona during the Festival Verona 1988. During this period, he also wrote the five volumes of his autobiography: The Ways of the Archangel (\u039f\u03b9 \u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5).\n\nIn 1989, he started the fifth period, the last, of his musical writing: He composed three operas (lyric tragedies) Medea, first performed in Bilbao (1 October 1991), Elektra, first performed in Luxembourg (2 May 1995) and Antigone, first performed in Athens' Megaron Moussikis (7 October 1999). This trilogy was complemented by his last opera Lysistrata, first performed in Athens (14 April 2002): a call for peace... With his operas, and with his song cycles from 1974 to 2006, Theodorakis ushered in the period of his Lyrical Life.\n\nFor a period of 10 years, Alexia Vassiliou teamed up with Mikis Theodorakis and his Popular Orchestra. During that time, and as a tribute to Theodorakis\u2019s body of work, Vassiliou recorded a double album showcasing some of the composer\u2019s most consummate musical creations, and in 1998, Sony BMG released the album entitled Alexia\u2013Mikis Theodorakis.\n\nTheodorakis is Doctor honoris causa of several universities, including Montreal, Thessaloniki, and Crete.\n\nTheodorakis holding hands with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou\nNow he lives in retirement, reading, writing, publishing arrangements of his scores, texts about culture and politics. On occasions he still takes position: in 1999, opposing NATO's Kosovo war and in 2003 against the Iraq War. In 2005, he was awarded the Sorano Friendship and Peace Award, the Russian International St.-Andrew-the-First-Called Prize, the insignia of Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of Luxembourg, and the IMC UNESCO International Music Prize, while already in 2002 he was honoured in Bonn with the Erich Wolfgang Korngold Prize for film music at the International Film Music Biennial in Bonn[59] (cf also: Homepage of the Art and Exhibition Hall Bonn).[60] In 2007, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the distribution of the World Soundtrack Awards in Ghent.\n\nA final set of songs entitled: Odysseia was composed by utilizing poetry written by Costas Kartelias for lyrics. In 2009 he composed a Rhapsody for Strings (Mezzo-Soprano or Baryton ad lib.)Created on 30 January 2013, Theodorakis achieved the distinction of producing one of the largest works by any composer of any time.\n\nMain works after 1974\nSong cycles: Ta Lyrika; Dionysos; Phaedra; Beatrice in Zero Street; Radar; Chairetismoi (Greetings); Mia Thalassa (A Sea Full of Music); Os archaios Anemos (Like an Ancient Wind); Lyrikotera (The More-Than-Lyric Songs); Lyrikotata (The Most Lyric Songs); Erimia (Solitude); Odysseia;\nMusic for the Stage: Orestia (dir.: Spyros Evangelatos); Antigone (dir.: Minos Volanakis); Medea (dir.: Spyros Evangelatos)\nFilm scores: Iphigenia (M.

The main goal of \"Spitha\" is to help Greece stay clear of its economic crisis.[65] On 31 May Mikis Theodorakis gave a speech attended by appropximately 10,000 Greeks in the center of Athens, criticising the Greek government for the loan debt it has taken from the International Monetary Fund.[66] It was also the first time in many decades that he called for revolution.[citation needed]\n\nWork\nSongs and song cycles\nTheodorakis has written more than 1,000 songs and song-cycles, whose melodies have become part of the heritage of Greek music: Sto Perigiali, Kaimos, Aprilis, Doxa to Theo, Sotiris Petroulas, Lipotaktes, Stis Nichtas to Balkoni, Agapi mou, Pou petaxe t'agori mou, Anixe ligo to parathiro, O Ipnos se tilixe, To gelasto pedi, Dendro to dendro, Asma Asmaton, O Andonis...\n\nHis song cycles are based on poems by Greek authors, as well as by Lorca and Neruda: Epitaphios, Archipelagos, Politia A-D, Epiphania, The Hostage, Mykres Kyklades, Mauthausen, Romiossini, Sun and Time, Songs for Andreas, Mythology, Night of Death, Ta Lyrika, The Quarters of the World, Dionysos, Phaedra, Mia Thalassa, Os Archaios Anemos, Ta Lyrikotera, Ta Lyrikotata, Erimia, Odysseia.

She sings in both Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese (Min Nan) and is known for her naturally magnetic rich vocals and witty persona. Her well-known hits include \u300a\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u65f6\u5149\u300b\u3001\u300a\u6070\u4f3c\u4f60\u7684\u6e29\u67d4\u300b\u3001\u300a\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u591c\u300b\u3001\u300a\u8bfb\u4f60\u300b\u3001\u300a\u4f60\u7684\u773c\u795e\u300b and more. The peak of her popularity in Taiwan was from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s but she remains popular in mainland China.\n\nTaiwan songstress Tsai Chin is an unquestionably enduring force on the music scene, after achieving her earliest hits in the late 70s, scoring unparalleled fame in the 80s, and having her voice dominate much of the Chinese radio airwaves throughout the 80s and a good half of the 90s. \n\nEvene today, at the age of 49, Tsai Chin is never quite out of sight of her fans with all her ongoing concerts and musicals. Today, Our reporter Xiaohua reveals the amazing career of music legend Tsai Chin.\n\nIt's not easy to describe just how popular Tsai Chin has been with mere words, so perhaps the best proof comes from a classic scene in the Hong Kong movie \"The Infernal Affairs \", in which two opponents meet in a music shop and sit down shoulder to shoulder to appreciate the songs of Tsai Chin. One of the two makes a comment something like this: \"Her soprano tenor is sweet, while the alto is accurate, and the contralto bass is deep. In a word, it's transparent.\" This sums up the opinions of most fans really well. Her thick, natural, magnetic voice and captivating persona give Tsai Chin enduring charm. \n\nThe track you've been listening to is one of Tsai Chin's older hits called \"The Forgotten Time\". The song features Tsai Chin singing solo, her comfortable mezzo-soprano vocals featured, with barely any musical accompaniment at the opening. As its name suggests, the song aims to call back deeply buried memories within people's hearts, be they sweet or bitter. Tsai Chin's voice evokes soft melodies and deep emotions, already enough to ripple the serene surface of ones soul like a gentle breeze, even without the help of lyrics.\n\nTsai Chin's legend began with a singing competition during her first year in college. At that time, singing Taiwan school ballads with a guitar was very popular. Through that competition, she found her favorite guitar and started on her successful music career. She reached her prime in the 80s, picking up numerous music awards from Taiwan and Hong Kong touring across Asia, Europe and the USA. Tsai has released 41 albums all told and is widely popular throughout the Chinese world. One saying goes \"Wherever there are Chinese, you will find Tsai Chin.\" \n\n\"Just like Your Tenderness\" is the song that won Tsai Chin thundering fame in 1980. It was composed by late Taiwan musician, Liang Hongzhi, who passed away twenty years after writing the legendary hit. After all her ups and downs, Tsai has now really achieved a better understanding of the song: \n\n\"Actually, it's not a melancholy song. What it tells of is a kind of loneliness. Now after I've gone through many ups and downs in life, I understand the loneliness of the composer even better. Imagine his loneliness. He compares himself to an isolated island with no one around, where only the tender hand of the waves brings him comfort.\" \n\nNow with that explanation in mind, let's have a listen to this ever popular number, which is still the most requested song wherever Tsai Chin appears. \n\nAlthough she's had a singing career spanning almost three decades, she's still not perceived as being out of date. She grows with time the way wine gets better with age---and she's forever the favorite of music aficionados. Now after going through all the joys and sorrows of life, Tsai Chin's songs seem to have an even richer emotional quality. The warmth in her songs aims directly at the very soft corners of the heart, making a direct hit. The last song we're going to play for you is entitled \"Ferry Crossing\". The intensely poetic lyrics, written by famous Taiwan poet Xi Murong, go like this: \"Let us shake hands one last time, then I will withdraw my hand. There's not even a wild flower at the ferry crossing to give as a parting gift, so that we can only stare at each other. Take my blessings on the front of your gown. Tomorrow you'll be at the other end of the world.\" The song is a beautiful showcase of Tsai Chin's full-throated and rich voice, filled with nuance and emotion.\n\nTrivia\nIn one scene of the 2002 hit Hong Kong thriller movie Infernal Affairs, two rivals meet in a music shop and sit to appreciate the music of Tsai Chin.\n\nShe was once married to Taiwanese Director Edward Yang. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tsai+Chin\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

No, at that point, he was too busy thinking about, among other things, names. \"In the beginning, I didn't want to use my name because I thought it was too hard for people to deal with,\" explains Salas-Humara when discussing the origin of the Silos name. \"So I came up with a name that was two syllables, easy to roll of the tongue, and works in all languages more or less.\"\n\nWith a name in hand, as well as some (in his words) \"unexpected interest\" in About Her Steps, Salas-Humara put together a touring band. That line-up made Cuba, originally released in 1987, an exhilarating album that introduced the Silos' enviable ability to communicate effectively in both a whisper and a howl. Cuba attracted national attention. The video for \"Tennessee Fire\" was played by MTV and the band was voted \"Best New American Band\" by the Rolling Stone critic's poll. The band subsequently signed to RCA Records and the third album under the Silos name (self-titled, but often conveniently referred to as The One With The Bird On The Cover) was even better and led to an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. Its spacious, organic quality made it seem out of place in 1990; however, looking back at the album from within the Alternative-Indy glow of the decade's end, The Silos resonates like the work of visionaries.\n\nSince that landmark album, Salas-Humara has kept the Silos name alive with a continuing series of impassioned recordings and miles and miles of roadwork. Four Silos studio albums, Hasta La Victoria (1992) and Susan Across The Ocean (1994), Heater (1998). Laser Beam Next Door (2001), and When The Telephone Rings (2004) followed. The latest album, Come On Like The Fast Lane, is their most accomplished to date, mixing primitive rock, edgy psychedelia and down-home organic soul without reservation. Salas-Humara has also released several solo albums, produced several others for such kindred spirits as Michael Hall and Jim Roll, was a founding member of the seminal soul\/drone band The Vulgar Boatmen, did some guest drumming on Hazeldine's Orphans, and joined Hall and Alejandro Escovedo in a two-off named The Setters. Ira Robbins, writing in The Trouser Press Record Guide, describes Salas-Humara as an \"unflashy auteur whose alt-rock amalgam drapes country, punk, baroque stateliness and pop in an abiding sadness.\" When you look at Salas-Humara's wide-ranging career and his dedication to the art of songwriting, it's definitely not a stretch to include his name alongside the likes of Escovedo, REM, Lucinda Williams, Stephen Malkmus, and Neil Young.\n\nThese days, Salas-Humara is enjoying the stability of a Silos line-up that's been together longer than any other, closing in on nine years, with Drew Glackin on bass and lap steel and Konrad Meissner on drums. \"We all enjoy each other's company quite a bit\" is Salas-Humara's take on this longevity. \"And stylistically, it all locks together in an interesting way. Visceral guitar playing combined with very melodic bass work and eclectic drumming works in a trio format. And to have the steel guitar (courtesy of Glackin) on the quieter songs adds a whole other dimension.\"\n\nThe Silos create a sound that's hard to pin down. According to Buzz McClain in The Washington Post, the band creates \"powerful earthy pop that sounds like the result of Nirvana riding on R.E.M.'s tour bus.\" \"The band's austere style inflects the astringent twang of The Velvet Underground with the drone of R.E.M. and adds countryish echoes that recall Gram Parsons,\" offered Stephen Holden in The New York Times. \"We get compared to everybody,\" says Salas-Humara. \"To some people, we're a country band. To other people, we're a rock band. To other people, we're an acoustic band. Some people think we're rootsy, and others think we're arty.\" He pauses to take a breath and to chuckle at the breadth of it all. \"We're all of those things.\"\n\nYes, every one of those descriptions is accurate, a snapshot of the truth taken from a different angle. The music of Salas-Humara and his bandmates is the sound of ideas, styles, and maybe even cultures colliding. It deftly combines a big beat with a nothing-wasted leanness, and it's music that possesses a unique blending of intensity and approachability, with the ferocious rockers tilting you back on your heels just as quickly as the hushed, tightly coiled ballads draw you closer.\n\nSo how should one sum up the music of the Silos? With a new album on the shelves and a trail of memorable shows (from performances in large music halls to intimate house concerts) both behind them and in front of them, let's just call it enduring.\n\nWritten By: \u2014Rick Cornell\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Silos\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

His father was the renowned tenor Karl Ots.\n\nBefore studying singing with the Estonian baritone Aleksander Arder in Yaroslavl, where an Estonian cultural centre had been established, Ots was a young Navy Officer who had escaped a sinking ship and taken prisoner in Russia. He was released a year later, and on his return home he auditioned for the conservatory in Tallinn. At the same time, he became a member of the chorus at the Estonian National Theatre in Tallinn. His solo opera debut was a tiny part in Eugene Onegin (1944). He soon became one of the most revered singers with this opera company, with whom he sang with from 1951 until his untimely death in 1975.\n\nOts was also a welcomed performer in all the major opera houses of the former Soviet Union, being especially popular at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. His repertoire included the roles of: Eugene Onegin, Yeletzky, Escamillo, Renato, Don Giovanni, Papageno, Rigoletto, Iago, Porgy, Figaro, and the title role in Kabalevsky's [[Colas Breugnon]. Ots sang in Estonian, Russian, Finnish, German, Italian and French, and was fluent in all six languages. Ots's most famous role, with which he is often identified with, was the leading character in Anton Rubinstein's opera The Demon. The libretto of The Demon is based on Mikhail Lermontov's famous epic poem, once banned because of its plot line which involves a misalliance between a dark angel and a Georgian princess. Georg Ots's interpretation of the Demon was admired and loved all over Russia, and made Lermontov's controversial poem even more famous.\n\nThe popularity of Ots culminated in 1958 with the release of the Lenfilm Studio musical Mister X, based on Imre Kalman's operetta Die Zirkusprinzessin. Ots also played a leading role in Between Three Plagues, a film based on a historical novel by Jaan Kross which illuminates the life of Balthasar Russow (played by Ots), a distinguished Estonian writer and chronicler. Russow (1536-1600) was the author of Chronicle of Livonia, a masterpiece which describes the life `of` and `in` Estonia between the 12-th and 16-th century and is one of the most important literary works on Estonian culture and history of that period.\n\nOts loved to perform songs by Schubert, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky and several other Russian composers, and was also a devoted interpreter of Estonian folk songs. His voice could be heard on radio and TV all over the Soviet Union, and all his records sold out almost immediately.\n\nHe also performed successfully in various European countries and in the United States. After his death in 1975, the Estonian Music High School was named after him. A plant, a ferry and a street also bear his name. In 1997, Russian scientists gave his name to a newly discovered minor planet. He was married three times (to Margot, Asta and Ilona Ots respectively) and had two daughters, a son (daughter \u00dclle and son \u00dclo with Asta, and daughter Mariann with Ilona) and two adopted sons (Hendrik and J\u00fcri). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Georg+Ots\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Joe Brown (born Joseph Roger Brown on 13 May 1941, in Swarby, Lincolnshire) is a popular British entertainer of the 1960s and beyond\n\n2. Joe Brown is also a virtually unknown harmonica player who appears on the Negro folk music of Alabama series.  \n\n3. A Korean hip-hop artist who is also in the Jiggy Fellaz crew.\n\n\n1) JOE BROWN:  Joseph Roger \"Joe\" Brown, MBE (born 13 May 1941,[1] Swarby, Lincolnshire) is an English entertainer.\n\nHe has worked as a rock and roll singer and guitarist for more than five decades. He was a stage and television performer in the late 1950s and a UK recording star in the early 1960s.[2] He has made six films, presented specialist radio series for BBC Radio 2, appeared on the West End stage alongside Dame Anna Neagle and has written an autobiography. In recent years he has again concentrated on recording and performing music, playing two tours of around 100 shows every year and releasing an album almost every year.\n\nDescribed by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, as a \"chirpy Cockney\", Brown was one of the original artists managed by the early rock impresario Larry Parnes.[1] He is highly regarded in the music business as a \"musician's musician\" who \"commands respect and admiration from a wide spectrum of artists\".[2]\n\nCareer\n\nBrown's family moved to London when he was two and ran the Sultan public house in Grange Road, Plaistow.[citation needed] In 1956, Brown formed the Spacemen skiffle group,[2] which lasted until the skiffle movement faded towards the end of the 1950s. In 1958 Brown was spotted by television producer Jack Good who hired him as lead guitarist in the orchestra of his new TV series, Boy Meets Girls.[3] During this period he backed a number of U.S musicians such as Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran on their U.K tours.[4]\n1960s\n\nBrown signed a management agreement with impresario Larry Parnes[5] and signed to Decca Records. He charted with \"The Darktown Strutters Ball\" in 1960 and had UK Top 10 hits on the Piccadilly label in 1962-63 with \"A Picture Of You\", \"It Only Took A Minute\" and \"That's What Love Will Do\".[2] Piccadilly's release of Brown's \"Crazy Mixed Up Kid\" in April 1961 was the label's first single.[6] Brown's recording band was a collection of session musicians, and was named the Bruvvers by Jack Good to give Brown the identity of having his own backing band for record releases. It was in 1962 when he needed a band to tour with him that 'Joe Brown and the Bruvvers' was cemented, containing two members of the Spacemen, brothers Tony and Pete Oakman, who had also remained with him in the \"Boy Meets Girls\" band.[2]\n\nBrown was voted 'Top UK Vocal Personality' in the 1962 NME magazine poll.[1] During the 1960s Brown appeared in a number of films, pantomime and stage musicals. In December 1963, the film What a Crazy World, based on a stage play, starring Brown and Marty Wilde among others, had its world premiere in London,[7] while he also starred in the hit musical Charlie Girl in the West End between 1965 and 1968. He presented the children's television series, Joe & Co, on BBC Television, three series of The Joe Brown Show for ITV.\n1970s and after\n\nIn 1972, he formed another band, Brown's Home Brew, which played rock and roll, country and gospel music and featured his wife, Vicki Brown, who died of cancer in 1991, and Pete Oakman from the Bruvvers. This eclectic collection of musical styles, together with his hits, became the basis of his live sets ever since.\n\nIn the 1980s Brown presented a daytime quiz show on ITV called Square One, it's success led him to recording a pilot for the prime time game show The Price Is Right but ATV selected Leslie Crowther for the full time presenting role when the series launched.\n\nGeorge Harrison was best man at Brown's second marriage in 2000; Brown had appeared on two songs on Harrison's album, Gone Troppo, and also featured on a track on Harrison's last album, Brainwashed. Following Harrison's death from lung cancer on 29 November 2001, Brown appeared with his group at the tribute concert Concert for George singing \"Here Comes the Sun\", \"That's The Way It Goes\" and \"I'll See You in My Dreams\", accompanying himself on the ukulele for the latter.[8]\n\nBrown still performs and makes occasional television appearances. In 2005 he co-wrote a musical, Don't You Rock Me Daddio, with songwriter Roger Cook,[9] while in December 2006, he was one of three guest hosts of Sounds of the 60s on BBC Radio 2 during the absence of host Brian Matthew, having already presented two series on rock and roll for the same station.\n\nIn 2008 Brown's 50th anniversary celebrations included a UK gold album for sales over 100,000 copies of Joe Brown - The Very Best Of, a 37 date spring tour, an all-star concert at the Royal Albert Hall with Mark Knopfler, Jools Holland, Dennis Locorriere, Dave Edmunds, Sam Brown, Chas & Dave and others, and a 36 date autumn\/winter tour.\n\nHis album, More Of The Truth was released in the UK on 13 October 2008, and early in 2009 the US musical instrument manufacturer, Kala, launched a series of 'Joe Brown' ukuleles. At the Mojo magazine's awards in London on 11 June 2009, Brown was presented with the lifetime award for outstanding contribution to music after 51 years' recording. Mojo's album, Harrison Covered (November 2011), to mark the 10th anniversary's of George Harrison's death, included Brown's recording of the former's \"That's the Way It Goes\".\n\nBrown was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours, for services to music.[10]\n\nIn late 2010 Joe Brown was asked by Rick Parfitt of Status Quo to support them for 10 nights of their UK tour in late 2010,[citation needed] and he has continued to tour throughout 2011. A triple DVD and CD set of the latter tour was released of his show at the Liverpool Philharmonic.[11]\n\nBrown's daughter, Sam Brown, is also a singer and his son, Pete Brown,[12] is a record producer, who produced all but one of Brown's nine most recent albums and also tours with Joe.

He claimed to be the 16th generation of hereditary musicians hailing from the Kalawant. Mehdi Hassan received his musical training and grooming under his father, Ustad Azeem Khan and his uncle Ustad Ismail Khan who were classical musicians and well-versed in Dhrupad and Khayal singing. They instructed him in classical music and voice rendition within the framework of classical forms of Thumri, Dhrupad, Khayal and Dadra, from the young age of eight. After the Partition of India, 20 year-old Mehdi Hassan and his family migrated to Pakistan and suffered severe financial hardships. To make ends meet, Mehdi Hassan began working in a bicycle shop and later became a car and diesel tractor mechanic. Despite the hardships, his passion for music didn't wither and he kept up the routine of practice (Riyaaz) on a daily basis.\n\nThe struggle ended when Mehdi Hassan was given the opportunity to sing on Radio Pakistan in 1952, primarily as a Thumri singer, which earned him recognition within the musical fraternity. At the time, Ustad Barkat Ali Khan, Begum Akhtar and Mukhtar Begum were considered the stalwarts of Ghazal Gayaki (genre).\n\nMehdi Hassan also had a passion for Urdu poetry and began to experiment by singing ghazals. He cites  Z.A. Bukhari and Rafiq Anwar, renowned broadcasters and producers of radio Pakistan as additional influences in his progression as a ghazal singer. They gave him ample opportunities to display his mastery over the ghazal on radio. He sang ghazals of all the renowned Urdu poets and his innovative style was soon appreciated by both masses and discerning audiences.\n\nMehdi Hassan\u2019s voice and unique performance skills in ghazal singing were unmatched in the world of South Asian music. The 60s and 70s can be named Mehdi Hassan\u2019s decades, as there was hardly any hero in the Pakistani musical scene on whom Mehdi Hassan\u2019s songs were not filmed.\n\nHe is universally acclaimed as the finest ghazal singer of his time, perhaps of all times. His unsurpassable vocal range and his mastery over even the most difficult of raags makes him the undisputed emperor of ghazals. His popularity amongst the masses, appreciation by the masses, and continued success over five decades makes him at par with Noor Jehan and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan in the league of the greatest Pakistani singers of all time. The ultimate tribute to his greatness was from the eternal nightingale, Lata Mangeshkar, who compared his songs to \" Voice of God \" . Talat Aziz as well as Indian ghazal singer Jagjit Singh are amongst his famous disciples.\n\nFollowing a severe illness in the late 80s, Mehdi Hassan stepped down from playback singing. Later due to severity of his illness he completely departed from music. He now lives a secluded life in Karachi which he has made his permanent residence. Nevertheless he often visits Lahore where he spends most of his time with his children and other family members.\n\nTowards the end of 2000, he suffered his first stroke while in Kerala, India. In 2005, he was taken to India for ayurvedic treatment where he was welcomed by A.B. Vajpayee, Dilip Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and many of his Indian fans. He suffered his second stroke soon after he returned from India which left him with speech impairments and limited his physical mobility. Hassan developed a severe chest infection and breathing difficulties in the days preceding his death. He died of multiple organ failure on 13 June 2012 at Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi.\n\nHe has been the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions: the Tamgha-i-Imtiaz granted to him by Gen Ayub Khan; the Pride of Performance bestowed on him by Gen Ziaul Haq; and the Hilal-i-Imtiaz conferred by Gen Pervez Musharraf. Besides the Nigar Film and Graduate Awards from Pakistan, he was presented the Saigal Award in Julandhar, India, in 1979, whereas the Gorkha Dakshan Bahu Award was given to him in Nepal in 1983. Recently, he travelled to Dubai to receive yet another award. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mehdi+Hassan\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Her self-titled 1963 album, led by the hit single \"La partita di pallone\" (\"The Ball Game\") made her a national star at 17, and international attention soon followed.\nIn 1968, Pavone married the contest's organizer, the also well known Italian singer Teddy Reno.\nIn 1965, Pavone participated as a musician guest in The Ed Sullivan Show, becoming a frequent guest there until 1970. Meanwhile, Pavone scored a string of hits, both with ballads and rock songs, in Spain, where she became a teen idol. Pavone enjoyed so much fame in Spain that it was commented, during a 2005 television documentary from that country, that such success for a foreign singer there is indeed rare.\nRita Pavone in the United States sang alongside Diana Ross and The Supremes, Ella Fitzgerald, Tom Jones, Duke Ellington and a number of singers of the era. It is said that Elvis Presley made a painting of her after she went to Memphis and he met her at a recording studio. Barbra Streisand recorded a duo with her.

In school, Kim Anh excelled academically.  In 1969, she received a scholarship that enabled her to study abroad in Washington, D.C. as an accounting major.\n\nKim Anh began her career as a professional singer for the Vietnamese community in the United States during the year of 1975 after she was approached by the owner of a Chinese restaurant called Empress in Washington, D.C., an American of Chinese descent who was in need of her interpretorial assistance with members of a Vietnamese band he had just hired.  After a few times singing with the band during open mic, she would be asked to become their lead vocalist.  For the next couple of years, Kim Anh would become the toast of the town in the Vietnamese community in Washington, D.C. as she enchanted audiences with her powerful vocals and smooth renditions of popular songs in Vietnamese, Chinese and English.  Despite the sizable following she had been able to acquire in a relatively short period of time, Kim Anh's road to fame would not be without its challenges.\nAfter having achieved such notoriety as a local performer in the Vietnamese community of Washington, D.C., Kim Anh was invited to perform at the 1977 Summer Vietnamese Festival of Performing Arts, Dai Nhac Hoi He '77, that had been organized by veteran actress of South Vietnamese cinema, Tuy Hong.  At the festival, Kim Anh would deliver an unforgettable performance of Qian Yan Wan Yu (A Thousand Words) in Mandarin and left the audience that was 1,000 strong in attendance with a lasting impression.  Within weeks after her triumphant performance which formally had introduced her to the Vietnamese-American community on a grander scale, Kim Anh was involved in a near fatal automobile accident.  Wheelchair bound for nearly two years, her rehabilitation would be a slow and painful process.  According to Kim Anh, this was when she began her addiction with drugs that had been prescribed to her by doctors for pain treatment.\nIn 1982, Kim Anh recorded her first studio solo album entitled Mua Thu La Bay.  The title track was a cover of the theme song of The Young Ones, a Taiwanese romance film in 1972 starring Chen Chen that was extremely popular with movie audiences of South Vietnam.  Other memorable tracks recorded on the album included Le Da written by Tran Trinh, Diem Xua written by Trinh Cong Son, Xin Con Goi Ten Nhau written by Truong Sa and Nua Dem Ngoai Pho written by Truc Phuong.  The album would become one of the all time bestsellers in the history of the overseas Vietnamese music industry.\n\nThe overwhelming success of Mua Thu La Bay instantly turned Kim Anh into a star and made her one of the busiest overseas Vietnamese singers during the 1980s and the 1990s.  She performed at live shows for overseas Vietnamese communities all over the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia and collaborated with numerous music production labels such as Da Lan, Doi Magazine, Truong Thanh, Thanh Lan, Lang Van, Asia Productions and Thuy Nga Paris.  She continued to release a series of solo studio albums and also recorded a duet album with Duy Quang, Mat Le Nguoi Tinh, for the Thanh Lan label released in 1984.  Her recording of Toc Em Chua Ua Nang He written by Pham Manh Cuong was the featured song during the opening credits of volume 3 of the popular video series, Paris By Night, in 1986.  Three years later, Kim Anh made her debut performance on the Paris By Night stage with Tam Hon Co Don written by Anh Bang.  Before Nguyen Cao Ky Duyen and Nguyen Ngoc Ngan became the permanent hosts of Paris By Night, Kim Anh and Tran Quoc Bao were the first returning hosts of the popular video series as the pair had hosted volume 15 in 1991 and volume 18 in 1992.  Other memorable appearances by Kim Anh on the Paris By Night stage included her performances of Mua Thu Yeu Duong, Gio Nay Anh O Dau and Tinh Ca Mua He.  In the 2000s, she made several well received appearances on the popular video series produced by Asia Productions which included duet performances with Tuan Vu, Thien Kim and most notably, Thai Doanh Doanh, in a rendition of her signature song, Mua Thu La Bay.  In 1994, Kim Anh released her solo music videotape entitled Duong Xua Loi Cu which consisted of music videos to several of her recorded songs filmed in Vietnam.  Among her other popular recorded songs include Sao Danh Xa Em, Canh Hong Trung Quoc and Nang Chieu.  It should be noted that Kim Anh was the very first overseas Vietnamese singer to have made an impact in Vietnamese music as she had risen to fame years before the likes of Ngoc Lan, Kieu Nga and Nhu Mai had come along.   \nIn recent years, Kim Anh has spent most of her time living and working in Vietnam.  Now in her sixties, she has long overcome her previous battle with drug addiction and continues a fast paced schedule of nightly performances at various venues in Ho Chi Minh City along with concert tours all over Vietnam.  Kim Anh is a mother of two grown sons.  Her oldest son is from her first marriage back in the early 1970s and her youngest son was born in Paris from her second marriage during the 1980s. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kim+Anh\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

In fact, Y lan did not start singing professionally until a few years ago. According to Y Lan, she was encouraged to pursue education instead of the arts while growing up in Vietnam.\n\nWhile she was still in Vietnam, Y Lan owned a cafe to host a number of artists who remained in the country after 1975. She arrived in the United States only within the past ten to eleven years. Y Lan continued to support her family, playing the role of a business woman. She never considered becoming a singer. In fact, Y Lan was very hesitant when she was approached by the president of Diem Xua production to pursue a singing career.\n\nY Lan eventually collaborated with Mr. Ngoc Chanh and became a regular at the Ritz, his night club in Orange County. Already influenced by her mother at an early age, this time, she had her mother's blessings and support as well. Y Lan became a phenomenal success in a relatively short time compared to other stars of the same status.\n\nSince her debut, Y Lan has recorded many CDs and has performed in many videos.

He wrote outrageous short stories for the school papers and in 1968 he also published the sheet music and lyrics to 14 songs, many of which would be released on his first records. As a young bohemian writer, he was inspired by Bob Dylan and Ray Davies, and embarked into songwriting, but his works were not copies of the American or British idols, but in fact, his songs were very original.\n\nAt the beginning of the seventies, his music works were not accessible to the audience as Megas only performed them to his friends of the left-wing circles. However in 1972, Icelandic students in Oslo, Norway helped him release his first album, in which diabolic and satiric lyrics were accompanied by a mild acoustic music played by Norwegian folk musicians. This work caused controversy and was his music was banned by the Icelandic national radio, but Megas became a cult figure in the growing alternative scene.\n\nIn 1973, as Megas found it difficult to release further albums, he published his verses and music in 3 books.\n\nWhen his original lyrics were performed with the electric rock band Judas in 1975, Megas managed to reach a broader audience. Several of those songs lampooned the Icelandic cultural legacy, including his two next albums: Millilending (1975) and Fram og aftur blindg\u00f6tuna (1976), which were much heavier than the first one. He focused on topics that challenged all of Icelandic society\u2019s taboos with references made to classical literature and a sarcastic revisionist history. His work polarized the audience, splitting them into a hostile minority and an enthusiastic majority. His songs remarkable poetry and use of Icelandic language proved a novel way to boost Icelandic rock and roll.\n\nIn 1977 Megas released \u00c1 bleikum n\u00e1ttkj\u00f3lum with the accompaniment of Spilverk \u00fej\u00f3\u00f0anna, a very popular folk-rock band. This album was voted the best Icelandic album ever made, and with a variety of music styles, it features what many critics considered the first Icelandic punk song. By the end of the seventies, Megas was perceived as a provocateur and his important roll in the Icelandic rock scene turned him into a reference for future artists.\n\nThen, he released a children\u2019s song album and a double live album and withdrew from the Icelandic music and started working as a dock worker and graduated from arts school.\n\nBy 1983 reappeared in the Icelandic music scene by collaborating with other bands and playing as a guest musicians on several albums.\n\nTowards 1985 joined KUKL in a new project was named MEGAKUKL and toured all over Iceland recording around 20 songs which still remain as unpublished material.\nAfter seven years of absence, his solo career was resumed in 1986 with the release of \u00cd g\u00f3\u00f0ri tr\u00fa.\n\nThree albums by Megas have featured Bj\u00f6rk as backing vocalist; Loftmynd (1987), H\u00f6fu\u00f0lausnir (1988) and H\u00e6ttuleg hlj\u00f3msveit og gl\u00e6pakvendi\u00f0 Stella (1990).

Pernice has also made two solo outings, one under the name Chappaquiddick Skyline. \n\nTheir music is distinguished by Pernice's silky, breathy vocals, reminiscent of Colin Blunstone or Nick Drake. He cites many musical influences: Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr, as well as Jimmy Webb, The Carpenters, and The Bee Gees. The deceptive simplicity, seductive melodies and soaring choruses of his songs also attract comparisons with the Beach Boys, Big Star, The Hollies and The Zombies. Yet the band can as easily sound like The Cure or New Order.\n\nPernice is also a fine lyricist (he has a master's degree in creative writing). His songwords show that Pernice can not only tackle difficult and offbeat subjects, but that he has a Morrissey-esque dark sense of humour too. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Pernice+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

During her childhood, she lived in France and later in London, where she faced antisemitism and physical abuse from classmates. As a result, she decided to change her first name to \u201cSi,\u201d a family nickname, once she was old enough.\n\nAt age 12, she returned to Israel on her own and rejoined Kibbutz Beit Alfa, where she lived as a \u201cchild from outside.\u201d At 13, she wrote and composed her first song, Ten Lanu Lichyot (\u201cLet Us Live\u201d), which won first place in a school music competition.\n\nHiman rose to prominence in the israeli rock scene during the 80s and became one of its defining voices. With a raw and emotional performance style, she stood out in a male-dominated genre and became a trailblazer for women in Israeli rock. Her breakthrough came with the hit Tel Aviv 89, which captured the restless spirit of urban youth and remains a cult classic. Her rendition of Kmo Tzemach Bar (\u201cLike a Wild Plant\u201d), originally written by her father, is considered one of her most iconic performances, blending personal legacy with national sentiment.\n\nOver the years, she released several acclaimed albums, collaborated with leading Israeli musicians, and appeared in film, theater, and television. Her music often reflects themes of personal struggle, independence, love, and social identity. Despite career highs and personal challenges, Himan continues to perform and record, and is recognized today as a seminal figure in Israeli music history\u2014respected both for her artistry and her uncompromising authenticity.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/\u05e1\u05d9+\u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05de\u05df\n\nWiki: https:\/\/he.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/\u05e1\u05d9_\u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05de\u05df <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Si+Himan\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He was a young boy when his parents moved to Lybertsy, a suburb near Moscow. While still in school, Barykin sang and played guitar in an amateur band called Allegro. He went to musical school and then earned a degree in the classical vocal program at the Gnesins Musical College.\n\nIn the 1970s, Barykin was a member of the VIA bands Moskvichi (1973 \u2014 1974), Vesiolie Rebiata (1974 \u2014 1976, 1978 \u2014 1979), Samotsvety (1976) and Jemchug (1976 \u2014 1978).\n\nIn August, 1979, Barykin collaborated with the guitarist of Samotsvety, Vladimir Kuzmin to organize a new band called Carnaval. It was considered to be the first Russian band to embrace new wave. Carnaval combined a range of styles and influences, including glam rock, rhythm and blues, and white reggae on the base of Russian melodic. In 1982, Kuzmin has organized his band Dynamic, and Barykin became the single leader of Carnaval. In 1985, the band experimented with pop rock (and after the album Rock'n'roll Marathon passed to this style). In 1989, they released a pure rock album Hey, Look! and broke up soon thereafter.\n\nAs member of Carnaval, Barykin released 15 albums, including 3 releases with the Soviet recording monopolist Melodiya, 5 compilations, and 1 live album at Moroz Records (see Discography of Carnaval). In 1990, Barykin started a successful solo career (in the beginning as a pop singer) and subsequently released 13 albums (see Discography of Alexander Barykin).\n\nBarykin is considered by many as a father of Russian reggae. (See in External links Video No. 2 and Video No. 4 from second row and Video No. 1 from third row).\n\nA number of Russian musicians and songwriters were influenced by Barykin. For example, the reggae styled hit of the band Chaif Argentina \u2014 Jamaica 5:0 was made in a style reminiscent of Barykin. In 2008 he sang the cover version in the TV show Superstar. Vadim Nikolayev: \"I regretted that it isn't Barykin's song almost ten years. But it became his song \u2014 at least for me\" (Notes About Russian Rock).\n\nIn the 1990s, Barykin began to experience problems with his vocal chords. After Islands (1996), Barykin did not release any new songs for a period of four years. After that period, he recovered and was able to continue his solo career.\n\nNear the end of his life, Barykin had reconstituted Carnaval together with such ex-members as guitarist Andrey Vypov, saxophonist and flutist Valentin Ilyenko, drummer Alexander Filonenko, and bass player Petr Makienko, with whom he played in Jemchug.\n\n\nBarykin had four children: Georgy Byrykin (born in 1974, also known as Georgy Barykin, singer, songwriter, the musician, he played on a guitar in the accompanying band of his father), Kira Byrykina (born in 1992, adopted in 1995), Yevgeniya Barykina (born on April 10, 2006) from his second marriage with singer Nelly Barykina (maiden name was Vlasova), and illegitimate son Timur Sayed-Shah (born in 1987, became a rapper) from singer Raisa Sayed-Shah.\n\nBarykin died of a heart attack on March 26, 2011, in Orenburg after a concert.

He was known for his style which fuses pop, rock, folk, world music and for his extensive vocal range. He is best known for the song \"Oro\", from his 1986 breakout album release Odissea. Other hits include \"Lei verr\u00e0\", \"Mediterraneo\", \"Bella d'estate\", \"Amore per te\", \"Come Monnalisa\", \"Nella mia citt\u00e0\" and \"La rondine\".\n\nMango has been defined by Italian music author Mario Luzzatto Fegiz as an \"authentic innovator of Italian pop music\"[1] and AllMusic considers him an \"Italian rock fusion innovator\".[2] He wrote songs for Italian artists such as Patty Pravo, Loredana Bert\u00e8, Andrea Bocelli, Mietta. Part of his repertoire was performed by Italian and foreign musicians, including Mina, Mia Martini, Leo Sayer, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne S\u00e9gara and Eleftheria Arvanitaki. [from Wikipedia - https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mango_(singer)]\n\n2) Mango, the popular Lithuanian pop girl trio, formed in 1998 with the aim of producing music that would resonate with their audience. The group was created and produced by brothers Mindaugas Bend\u017eius and Gintaras Bend\u017eius, who held a special competition to select the members of the band. After the competition, Rima Petrauskyt\u0117, Viktorija Perminait\u0117 and Asta Bridikyt\u0117 were chosen to join Mango. \n\nThe band's launch was an immediate success with the covers of \"Pavasariniai \u017eiedai\" (Spring Blossoms) and \"Svetimi\" (Strangers). Mango continued to achieve impressive milestones throughout their career, releasing nine albums that collectively sold over 310,000 copies. The band was recognized as the Band of the Year by Radiocentras Awards in 2000 and 2001 and by Bravo Awards in 2000. \n\nIn 2004, Mango faced a significant change when Asta Bridikyt\u0117 left the group and was replaced by Lina Kaklyt\u0117. Despite the change, the band continued to produce music and entertain their audience. However, in 2007, Mango announced their retirement after releasing their third compilation of their best songs. They embarked on a farewell tour across Lithuania, including special appearances for Lithuanian communities in England, Ireland, and the United States. The final concert took place on March 31, 2008, at \u0160iauliai Arena, bringing an end to the band's ten-year career.\n\nIn 2014, Mango singer Rima Petrauskyt\u0117-Paulauskien\u0117 and the Bend\u017eius brothers reunited MANGO with new members and continued releasing music under the new name \"MAN-GO\". Their return was a welcome development for their fans who had missed their music. \n\nIn 2018, Mango reached a significant milestone - their 20th anniversary in the Lithuanian music industry. This was a remarkable achievement for the band, and to commemorate the occasion, they released their 11th studio album, \"2020\". The album was an embodiment of Mango's signature sound, combining traditional Lithuanian folk music with contemporary pop beats and lyrics that celebrated love, life, and the human experience. \"2020\" was met with widespread acclaim from Mango's loyal fanbase and music critics alike, cementing the band's position as one of the most influential and enduring acts in Lithuanian music history. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mango\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

She has two younger sisters, Dannielle and Elizabeth. Her family moved to Waldorf, Maryland soon after her birth and she set her heart on an entertainment career at the age of four. Milian shot commercials for (Wendy's, Honeycomb) and played the lead role in the musical Annie before moving to Los Angeles at thirteen to pursue an acting career. Soon after the family's move, her father divorced her mother. Milian graduated from Westlake High School in Waldorf, Maryland; and also attended Matthew Henson Middle School in Indian Head, Maryland.\n\nIn 2000, Milian made her first official musical appearance on Ja Rule's second studio album Rule 3:36, performing guest vocals on his song \"Between Me and You\". Released as the album's lead single in 2001, the track managed to peak at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and in the top 30 of the UK singles chart, building Milian's reputation as a singer. Milian also appeared in M\u00fda's video for \"Best of Me\" playing a friend. In the meantime Milian co-wrote and provided extensive backing vocals for the track \"Play\" for Jennifer Lopez's 2001 album J. Lo which became another success. Milian would later pass down the song to Lopez because of already having a club song with \"AM to PM\" as promotion. She also went on to co-write \"Same Ol' Same Ol\", the first single from girl group PYT's debut album Down With Me.\n\nIn 2001, Milian eventually released her first solo single, \"AM to PM\", off her self-titled debut album. The song became a worldwide hit reaching the top 5 in the UK and Denmark, top 10 in the Netherlands, and top 30 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and in Australia. The success of \"AM to PM\" sparked the international release of the Christina Milian album which she co-wrote and produced, although not in the United States. The second single \"When You Look At Me\" was another international hit reaching the top 5 in the UK, Netherlands, and Ireland and making the top 40 in Denmark, Germany, Australia, and France. Although a music video for the album's third single \"Get Away\" (another collaboration with Ja Rule) was filmed in Paris, the single was not released officially.\n\nAfterwards Milian also was featured on the track \"It's All Gravy\", a duet with British Rapper Romeo of the UK garage group So Solid Crew. While the song was another UK top ten hit single in 2002, Milian provided the theme song for the hit Disney series Kim Possible, \"Call Me, Beep Me\" later that year. In 2002, she also collaborated with Hilary Duff on her Christmas album Santa Claus Lane, on the song \"I Heard Santa on the Radio.\"\n\nIn 2003, Milian started recording songs with Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, Bloodshy & Avant and Cory Rooney for her first U.S. release, It's About Time (whose title is a direct reference to how long it had taken for one of her albums to be released domestically). The album was released to positive reviews on July 13, 2004, but failed to receive immense commercial success when it debuted at #21 in the UK and #14 on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling over 36,000 copies in the first week only. While It's about Time ended up with lackluster sales of 394,000 copies in the United States, it gained prominence when it received a Grammy nomination for \"Best Contemporary R&B Album\" in 2005.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Dip It Low\" (written by singer Teedra Moses and Black Eyed Peas producer Poli Paul) however, became Milian's biggest hit to date, when it peaked at #1 on a world composite dance chart (compiled on data from the U.S., UK, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Australia), simultaneously reaching #2 in the UK, #5 in the U.S., #7 in New Zealand and the top 20 in Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands. The single was also certified Gold by the RIAA for digital sales. The album's second and final single, \"Whatever U Want\" (featuring Joe Budden) failed to reprise the success of the lead single, but again reached the top 10 in the UK as well as charting on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nMilian's third studio album So Amazin' was released on May 16, 2006. Milian worked with Cool & Dre on the majority of the production of the album, and the project was finished with additional help from Rich Harrison and executive producers Jay-Z and LA Reid. Christina mentions working with Cool & Dre for the entire album \"made a more consistent, very real and personal album\" compared to her other works. The record's first single \"Say I\" featured rapper Young Jeezy and was released in March 2006 as a single and video. The song made it to number 1 on iTunes UK Music Store and was number 1 on AOL music, but altogether saw moderate success only with peak positions on #21 in the United States, #4 in the UK and #45 in Australia.\n\nWhile So Amazin' failed to reach the top 10 when it debuted at #11 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the album saw minor international success only, peaking at #67 in the UK inter alia. With \"Gonna Tell Everybody\" a second single from the album was chosen, but Island Def Jam neither agreed to film a music video nor booked promotional appearances for Milian to promote the song. In June 2006, instead, Milian's representative confirmed that she had left the Island Def Jam record label due to \"creative differences\" - though disappointing album sales were believed to be the main factor, since the album sold less than 500,000 worldwide (over 130,000 in United States).\n\nDue to the low sales of So Amazin', Milian released her first compilation album, titled The Best of Christina Milian on November 22, 2006. The album was released under the Universal International label. The album includes her hit singles and songs that she hand picked herself from her first three studio albums, Christina Milian, It's About Time, and So Amazin', though, only one track, Say I, was chosen from So Amazin', possibly due to the fact that it is her lowest selling album. The album was only released in Japan and some other Asian countries; but was not released in the U.S. or Europe. The album peaked at a disappointing #29 on the Japanese ORICON Albums Chart, and has sold only 38,078 copies to date.\n\nFollowing her departure from Island Def Jam Music Group, Milian signed with MySpace Records in 2008. She began writing songs and recording in the studio with numerous different producers, including Cool & Dre, J. R. Rotem, The Runners, Danja, Madd Scientist, T-Pain, Jim Jonsin and Toby Gad. Milian was featured on the cover of Rap-Up's 2008 Winter issue, in which she announced that the album's title was Dream in Color. A single was released in October 2008, ballad \"Us Against the World\". It was written by Milian and produced by Madd Scientist. The single, described by Milian as a \"cinematic power ballad\", premiered via MySpace on October 6, 2008, and was made available by digital download the next day. Milian felt that Madd Scientist \"brought the best out of me\" while producing \"Us Against the World\", and \"was really able to do some amazing things with my vocals\".\n\nAfter recording songs with the aforementioned producers, Milian took a break from music and started filming Bring It On: Fight to the Finish. When Milian returned to music, she concentrated on promoting her single \"Us Against the World\", and shot its music video. Since then, Milian said that she became \"a little bit more meticulous with what I feel deserved to be on the album\", and resumed recording. Songs recorded for the album included the 90's Madonna-styled ballad \"Stay\", Euro-club record \"Tug of War\" and the feel-good song \"Diamonds\", which featured Kanye West. Other features included Rick Ross on the Cool & Dre produced track \"Blissful\", and Pitbull.\n\nIn early 2009, Milian began working with The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, and L.O.S. Da Maestro, which led to her signing a deal with Radio Killa Records. Milian revealed that aside from \"Us Against the World\", The-Dream and Tricky Stewart would be producing all the songs on her album. In March 2009, Milian changed the album's title to Elope. Regarding the album's title change, Milian explained, \"the definition of elope is to run away secretly with one's beloved. This next album is about taking responsibility for yourself and making your own decisions.\" In June 2009, The-Dream said that the album was finished. Upon completion of the album, Milian said it represented \"independence, not having to answer to any type of 'authority', being a woman at her best and feeling very confident\". She said that fans could expect an \"edgy sound with lots of strong powerful anthems. Big up tempos, R&B and Pop at it's [sic] best and two big ballads\".\n\nIn August 2009, Milian confirmed that she had signed a deal to release Elope through Interscope Records, with a 2010 release date. Originally scheduled to be released in 2009, Tricky Stewart explained the delay, saying \"we just got our label deals done, so the reason why some of these projects got delayed had to do with technicalities and things of that nature\". The album has been furthered delayed because of Milian's marriage to The-Dream and her pregnancy. In January 2010, Milian said that she was going back into the studio in the summer to record more material. Although the album had already been finished when Milian took a break for her pregnancy, she wanted to \"go back and re-do some of the music and make some new songs and find my new inspiration\". In October 2009, Tricky Stewart said that another single had yet to be chosen, and that it would be the first single off Elope. Reported choices for the first single include \"Zipper\", \"I'm a Cheat\", and \"Supersonic\".\n\nOn February 26, 2010, Milian gave birth to their daughter Violet, although in July 2010, The-Dream announced that he and Milian had separated. Milian was scheduled to resume recording in July 2010 to complete the album; however, after her separation from The-Dream, Milian opted to focus on her acting career. Despite the separation, Milian and The-Dream continued to \"work together and write together\". At the 2010 Los Angeles Fashion Week, Milian performed \"Zipper\" and \"Dip It Low\". At the 2010 American Music Awards, Milian announced that her untitled fourth studio album will be released in 2011. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Christina+Milian\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Carola, a Brazilian DJ and producer born in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, has made significant strides in the electronic music scene. At 26 years old, she gained support from David Guetta for track, FKGO, with Kohen. This collaboration marks a major professional achievement for Carola, who views Guetta as a key influencer in the popularization of electronic music. Despite facing initial skepticism in her career, Carola's determination led her to success. Starting her journey in 2007, she immersed herself in electronic music, later delving into DJing in 2012. Overcoming financial constraints, she leveraged online resources to learn and eventually formed a close partnership with Kohen, whom she considers one of Brazil's top producers.\nCarola's family initially doubted her decision to pursue a career in music due to financial concerns, but they now take pride in her achievements. Inspired by Beyonc\u00e9 and influenced by electronic artists like Flume, Skrillex, and Diplo, Carola continually evolves her musical identity. Facing challenges and criticism, she maintains resilience, believing in her capacity to achieve anything she sets her mind to. As she navigates the early stages of her career, Carola anticipates further exploration and growth in her musical style. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Carola\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Thien Kim's extraordinary vocal talents were further proven with her abilities to sing in various different Vietnamese music genres such as traditional Vietnamese folk opera known as cai luong and vong co.  At the age of 14, she began performing regularly for major outdoor music venues and dance halls in Ho Chi Minh City.  In 1998, with the encouragement from both her parents, particularly her mother who was also a professional singer known by her stage name, Thanh Truc, Thien Kim entered the prestigious talent competition, Tieng Hat Truyen Hinh Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh, where she impressively placed second with her solo performance of Xa Vang, a song written by composer Nguyen Van Hien.\nDuring her freshman year in college, Thien Kim along with her family left their native Vietnam and emigrated to the United States on May of 1995.  Resettling in Orange County, California, Thien Kim immediately resumed her music career recording for Nhac Tinh, a smaller overseas Vietnamese production label.  She also found work as a regular performer at Vietnamese nightclubs around Orange County, beginning first briefly at the Can Nightclub in Garden Grove owned by singer Le Uyen (former member of a singing trio in Saigon known as The Loan Sisters) before joining the lineup of permanent performers at Ritz Nightclub in Anaheim owned by legendary promoter\/musician Ngoc Chanh.  Blessed with a strong, yet sensual lower-pitched singing voice and natural good looks, Thien Kim managed to acquire for herself a sizable following of fans which included not only audience members but also colleagues within the overseas Vietnamese music industry in just a short period of time after resettling in the United States.  Through an introduction from director and music videographer Howard Hue, singer Nhat Ha's then husband, Thien Kim was able to make her debut appearance on music videos in Sao Sang (Shining Star), produced by legendary singer Giao Linh for Giao Linh Productions and released in 1997.\n\nThe year of 1997 would prove to be a major turning point in Thien Kim's professional life.  She signed with Thuy Nga Paris as an exclusive artist for audio recordings and music video appearances on the popular live show series, Paris By Night.  Her debut on the Paris by Night stage was on volume 39 where she appeared as part of a trio alongside male artists, Lay Minh and Khanh Hoang, performing Lien Khuc Dem Do Thi, a medley of Vietnamese songs written by composers Y Van, Nguyen Anh 9 and Bang Giang.  Thien Kim remained with the Thuy Nga Paris label for a total of five years recording a series of solo studio albums which included Khi Nguoi Xa Toi (1997), Biet Lam Sao Thoi Nho (1998), Vi Sao (1999), Tinh La Gi? (2000), Sac Mau (2001) and Toc Gio Thoi Bay (2002), as well as a pair of duet albums with Quoc Hung, Con Gai Doi Muoi (1999) and Vo Sao Em Oi (2001), and a duet album with The Son, Neu Dieu Do Xay Ra (2000).  She appeared on 23 different volumes on the Paris by Night video series from 1997 until 2001 performing various songs as a solo artist, as well as occasional duets and ensemble performances alongside other artists such as Don Ho, Nguyen Hung, Nhu Quynh, Luu Bich, Phi Nhung, Lynda Trang Dai and Nhu Loan.\nIn 2002, Thien Kim left Thuy Nga Paris and has since been in association with Asia Entertainment.  Her popularity has continued with overseas Vietnamese audiences worldwide with her audio recordings and music video appearances for the Asia Entertainment label.  Among her most well-received performances with Asia Entertainment include renditions of songs such as Bien Nho written by Trinh Cong Son, Moi Em Ve written by Viet Dzung, Mua Dong Cua Anh written by Nhat Truong and several duets with legendary singers such as Le Thu, Le Uyen (of Le Uyen & Phuong), Kim Anh, Philip Huy, Nguyen Khang and Ngoc Huyen.\n\nIn her personal life, Thien Kim has been a cancer survivor and also holds a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California, Irvine.

After making a home for himself in Brooklyn upon graduating from SUNY at Albany, J relocated to Philadelphia in 2003. \"Moving to Philly was more for the family than any kind of career move. But the whole music scene here and the hip hop community here have embraced me with open arms since I arrived. I've gotten a lot of support from so many different artists and dee jays. This city is jam packed with talented and beautiful people.\"\n\nJ-Live started his career by releasing solid 12\" such as \"Longevity\", \"Braggin' Writes\", and \"Hush the Crowd\", which earned him a spot in The Source's \"Unsigned Hype\" column.\n\nRecorded mostly at J's own Triple Threat Studios in Philadelphia, The Hear After actually seems to have taken on a life of its own. Guest vocalist on the album, include up and coming artist, Kola Rock, Cvees, and the soulful sounds of Virgin recording artist, Dwele. The album features production by Floyd the Locsmif (Atl), Hezekiah, James Poysner (Philly), Probe DMS, Fire Dept., (NYC), Oddisee (DC), and J-Live himself. \"The title is a play on words. People think of the here after as the after life or somewhere you go when you die. Like heaven or hell. Me personally, I see heaven as being at peace with yourself while you're alive. I see hell as the path you choose in life as opposed to a place you go after death. The album is called The Hear After because I'm at peace with myself musically, and I've been through hell to get that way. This is what you \"hear after\" all that has transpired so far. This is what I've been working to accomplish since the last album.\"\n\nLike J's last two full length records, The Best Part and All of the Above, The Hear After covers a wide range of thoughts and emotions both musically and with its subject matter. \"If you were to look at the whole thing, you would see a story line about an artist trying to maintain and expand his career and still be there for his family. That was the biggest struggle while making the record, and its no coincidence that it's a theme that becomes obvious listening to it. But there are songs about almost every aspect of my life from growing up in the city, to raising kids, touring heavy, building and teaching, politics, party and bullshit. I can't just spit about one thing for a whole record. That's not my style.\"\n\nJ-Live has been rhyming and mixing since the age of 12 but he has made much more of a name for himself as an MC than as a DJ. \"I definitely focus on rhyming more. Growing up doing both it was easier on the pockets to be an MC. Records and equipment can get expensive. But I love spinning.\" One of the highlights of his entertaining live show is when he rhymes and beat juggles on the turntables simultaneously, performing his classic, \"Braggin' Writes.\" J-Live is also known to produce beats.\n\nJ-Live has always used music to get his messages across. He explains, \"I grew up listening to everything from BDP to NWA, to PE [[artist]Public Enemy], Slick Rick, Big Daddy Kane, Nice and Smooth. Whether the music was pimped out, gangsta, militant or whatever, rappers had something important to say to kids like me. And I listened intently. As a 5%er, I can't imagine how much of an influence hip hop had on the way I see the world.\"\n\nCase in point, J's favorite song on the album, \"Audio Visual\" is so descriptive it's a song \"in 3-D\". From the quirky, key accents to the thick-ass bottom running throughout the song, J-Live paints a colorful, picture of his life on and off the mic. \"Brooklyn Public\" is his ode to his days as an educator. Earlier in his career, J-Live taught middle school English\/Language Arts in Brooklyn for a few years.\n\nMaking music for the walkmans as well as the Jeeps, J-Live made a mature, sonically sophisticated album. \"I feel like I represent hip hop's middle class. Seems like everybody's either crying broke or screaming rich or both. I try to speak to the people in between. The everyday hard working fun loving hip hop heads.\"\n\nYear Formed: 1995\nOfficial Site: http:\/\/www.j-livemusic.com\/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/J-Live\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Rasheeda has been dubbed several times as \"Queen of Crunk\" and the \"Georgia Peach\".  She is best known for her hit single  \"My Bubble Gum\". She's also a member of female duo Peach Candy with R&B singer-songwriter Kandi_Burruss.\n\nRasheeda is a rapper and singer from Atlanta, Georgia, she released 5 albums and has appeared on tracks with Petey Pablo, Nelly, Nivea, Cherish, and Ciara's \"Goodies\" video. Rasheeda has been called several times as \"Queen of crunk\" She is known for his hit single \"My gum (Got that good) \"She is also a member of girl group Peach Candy. Rasheeda had an early start in her career. As an adolescent, she and two of her friends formed hip-hop girl group Da Kaperz, which began her career in the entertainment business. Da Kaperz signed on to D-Lo Entertainment, which Rasheeda works with to the present. The group had caught widespread attention by early 2000.\n \nJust a year later, Rasheeda began her career as a solo artist with Dirty South, a 2001 album between D-LO and Motown Records. With guest stars like Pastor Troy and Re-Re on board, the album quickly moved up the charts, with some of its tracks even labeled as new hip-hop anthems. Some of the other artists who also worked on Dirty South include Thugz Nation, Nelly and Jim Crow.\n \nWhile Dirty South placed her firmly in the hip-hop genre, Rasheeda moved on to a more specific niche. Her 2002 second album Ghetto Dream, an indie release under D-Lo, had her churning out beats with the likes of Lil Jon & the Eastside Boyz. The Ghetto Dream sound featured faster rhythms and stronger beats, making it an instant hit with the club crowd. It was also with this album that Rasheeda earned her title as the Queen of Crunk.\n \nRasheeda paid homage to her Southern roots with her third album, Georgia Peach. Working once more with D-Lo Entertainment, the more intimate lyrics in Georgia Peach were combined with a slightly slower rhythm. The sexier, dirtier lyrics made it another favorite in the club circuits. Her latest effort, 2007's Dat Type of Gurl, had Rasheeda reprise some of her earlier works from Georgia Peach. Many of her old tracks were updated with remixes and samples thrown in for good measure.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rasheeda\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Reared in a tough gang-riddled barrio, Ramos proved to be a \"diamond in the rough,\" getting in trouble but all the while expressing potential as an artist. Ramos eventually mastered the artistry of airbrushing low riders and tattooing; the musicianship of drumming and playing bass guitar; and, the techniques of DJing. But, all this talent was put on hold as Ramos went to the TDC penitentiary for five years.\n\nResuming a free life in 1997, Ramos by chance tattooed Dope House rapper Low G, who invited him out to a South Park Mexican concert. South Park Mexican turned out to be old schoolmate Carlos Coy reinvented as a Latino rap sensation. That began Ramos' unofficial rap-game apprenticeship as \"Juan Gotti\" with SPM and Dope House Records, filling in for Low G at low rider and rap shows around Houston from 1998.\n\nCiting DJ Screw, Street Military, Ram\u00f3n Ayala and Control Machete as influences, Gotti's first single \"Mira Lo Que Pasa\" a year later \"blew up,\" as he puts it. The full album, No Set Trippin', dropped in 2002, quickly snapped up a Latin Grammy\u00ae nomination and sold enough units to go \"ghetto gold\" (more than 50,000 by street standards).\n\n\"I thank Jesus. Glory to God,\" Gotti praises of his successes, \"Faith has kept me focused and Dope House has done wonders. Everyone was freaked out about how fast I moved up. Things happen for a reason because of God.\"\n\nGotti collaborated with Kings One, El Tri, La Traici\u00f3n and La Mafia, laying down vocals for their recent album, Para El Pueblo, and also featured Tejano-norte\u00f1o band Los Palominos on Gotti's next album. So, fans don't have to wait to hear Gotti-they can get a sampler of what's to come off any of these other projects. He also has a series of underground mixtapes, El M\u00e1s Locote, Vol. 1 & 2.\n\nMeanwhile, Gotti kicks things off with simultaneous releases for distinct markets-the first single \"Incondicional\" with La Traici\u00f3n for the regional Mexican market off upcoming album Juan Gotti aka John Ghetto drops in early 2005; alongside hip-hop track \"You Don't Wanna\"; and cumbia offering \"Para El Pueblo\" with La Mafia.

Over his career he has been known by several pseudonyms, including Kris Parker, KRS One, KRS-ONE (as given at his site), The Blastmaster and The Teacha. KRS-One is an acronym for \"Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody\". KRS-One is a significant figure in the hip hop community and is often referenced in works by other hip hop artists and critics as being the 'essence' of an MC and one of the greatest to ever hold the mic.\n\nKRS-One, originally a member of the hip hop crew Boogie Down Productions, is known for setting the path for both hardcore rap and socially conscious political rap.\n\nYouth and early career\n\nBorn Lawrence Parker in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1965, the future KRS-One grew up with his brother Kenny and their single mother in assorted inner city neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the Bronx. According to interviews with The Source Magazine, one fateful day when he was 12 years old, he and his brother Kenny prepared a pan of flavored rice, which was to be the family's dinner for the evening. The hungry pair ate the whole thing, and when their mother came home from work, she kicked them out of the apartment in a fit of anger. They stayed away for two days before younger Kenny decided to go back home, while Lawrence opted not to return. He spent the better part of the next seven years homeless, much of it at local libraries.\n\nIn his late teen years, Lawrence Parker fell in with some illegal drug dealers and became a courier. Using a bread delivery truck as a cover, Parker and his partner drove around town to make drops. During one of their trips, a police car pulled up behind them with flashing lights. Parker's partner panicked, and led the cops on a chase for several miles which ended with the truck crashing and the two being apprehended. At the trial, the judge made the commentary that the only reason the police had initially tried to pull them over was because they had private plates on a commercial vehicle, there was no original intent to search for drugs.\n\nParker, still a minor, claimed he was a ward of the state, and got sent to a juvenile home for his sentencing, after which he was moved to a Covenant House youth homeless shelter. It was there that he met Scott Sterling, a recent college graduate who just started working at the shelter as a social worker. Parker discovered that Sterling moonlighted as a hip hop DJ under the name Scott La Rock. By this time, Parker had earned the nickname \"Kris\" from the relationship he had developed with local Hare Krishnas that evangelized near the shelter. Heavily influenced by Eastern philosophies, he was also an aspiring rapper, and practiced routines in verbal spars with the other shelter residents.\n\nParker and Sterling, along with two other fellows, decided to form a rap group together, initially calling themselves \"Scott La Rock and the Celebrity Three\". That was short-lived, however, as the two peripheral members quit, leaving Parker (now calling himself KRS-One) and Sterling. They then decided to call themselves \"Boogie Down Productions\". Success is the Word, a 12-inch single release on indie Fresh\/Sleeping Bag Records (under the group name \"12:41\") did not enjoy commercial success. Soon after, the pair approached another NY indie, Rock Candy Productions, for a deal. As it turns out, the entertainment company was allegedly a front for a pornography operation, but Parker and Sterling convinced the boss to front them the money to record an album, under the newly created subsidiary label, B-Boy Records. After a few 12-inch single releases, the Criminal Minded album finally surfaced in 1987.\n\nCriminal Minded featured many dis tracks that attacked other hip hop emcees and tracks about street crime (\"wa da da deng wa da da da deng, listen to my nine millimeter go bang\"). KRS One and La Rock appeared on the cover of the album holding firearms, a controversial precedent that would be followed by many rap artists in the years to follow. Musically, the album was based around James Brown samples and reggae influences. They also sampled hard-rock band AC\/DC on \"Dope Beat\". During these years, KRS-One was also famously involved in a hip hop battle with MC Shan, of Queensbridge. KRS objected to MC Shan calling Queensbridge the home of hip hop, and attacked him viciously on a seminal battle rap, The Bridge Is Over.\n\nLater career and emphasis on political issues\n\nFollowing the fatal shooting of Scott La Rock in 1987, Boogie Down Productions (BDP) became increasingly political. KRS One was the primary motivation behind the HEAL compilation and the Stop the Violence Movement. KRS One attracted many prominent emcees to appear on the 12-inch single \"Self Destruction.\" As Parker adopted this more conscientious, less violent approach, he stopped calling himself \"The Blastmaster\" (his battle rap nickname), and instead began calling himself \"The Teacha\", turning the nickname KRS-ONE into the backronym \"Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone\".\n\nOn his first solo album, 1993's Return of the Boombap, KRS worked together with producers DJ Premier (Gang Starr), Showbiz and Kid Capri. The catchy yet very hardcore track \"Sound of da Police\" is featured on this album. His second album, KRS One featured Channel Live on the track \"Free Mumia\", a political protest song about Mumia Abu-Jamal, an imprisoned African-American and Black Panther member who a vocal group of activists on the political Left claim is innocent of the crime of which he was convicted. Other prominent guest artists on KRS One included Mad Lion, Busta Rhymes, Das EFX and Fat Joe.\n\nIn 1997, Parker surprised many with his release of the album I Got Next. The record included a remix of the single \"Step into a World\" which featured a sample from the 1970s rock group Blondie by commercial rap icon Puff Daddy. \"Heartbeat\", featuring Angie Martinez and Redman, was based on the old school classic \"Feel the Heartbeat\" by the Treacherous Three. These collaborations with notably mainstream artists took many fans and observers of the vehemently anti-mainstream KRS One by surprise. However, in August 1997 KRS One appeared on Tim Westwood's BBC Radio 1 show and vociferously denounced the DJ and the radio station more generally, accusing them of ignoring his style of hip-hop in favour of commercial artists such as Puff Daddy.\n\nIn 1999, there were tentative plans to release an album called \"Maximum Strength\"; a lead single, \"5 Boroughs\", was released on The Corruptor movie soundtrack. However, KRS apparently decided to abort the album's planned release, just as he had secured a position as a Vice-President of A&R at Reprise Records. KRS moved to southern California, and stayed there for two years, finally ending his relationship with Jive Records with A Retrospective in 2000. The next year, he resigned his position at Reprise and in 2001 The Sneak Attack was released on Koch Records. In 2002, he released a gospel-rap album, Spiritual Minded, surprising many longtime fans. Parker had once denounced Christianity as a \"slavemaster religion\" which African-Americans should not follow. He founded the Temple of Hiphop, and released a new album, Kristyles, in mid- 2003, which was preceded by KRS-One: The Mixtape. In the summer of 2004 he released Keep Right.\n\nKRS One's latest CD Life, was released in June 2006, and another CD, Adventures in Emceein on Koch Records is slated for later in the year. KRS has also confirmed for his next album of new material, expected to be out in 2007, he will be working with Marley Marl.\n\nSeptember 11 comments and ensuing controversy\n\nIn 2004, KRS engendered a controversy when he was quoted in a panel discussion hosted by New Yorker Magazine as saying that Blacks \"cheered when 911 happened\". The comment drew criticism from many sources, including a pointed barb by the New York Daily News that called Parker an \"anarchist\" and said that \"If Osama bin Laden ever buys a rap album, he'll probably start with a CD by KRS-One.\"\n\nParker responded to the furor surrounding his comments with an editorial written for AllHipHop.com. In it, Parker said \"I was asked about why hiphop has not engaged the current situation more (meaning 911), my response was 'because it does not affect us, or at least we don\u2019t perceive that it affects us, 911 happened to them'. I went on to say that 'I am speaking for the culture now; I am not speaking my personal opinion.' I continued to say; '911 affected them down the block; the rich, the powerful those that are oppressing us as a culture. Sony, RCA or BMG, Universal, the radio stations, Clear Channel, Viacom with BET and MTV, those are our oppressors those are the people that we're trying to overcome in hiphop everyday, this is a daily thing. We cheered when 911 happened in New York and say that proudly here. Because when we were down at the trade center we were getting hit over the head by cops, told that we can\u2019t come in this building, hustled down to the train station because of the way we dressed and talked, and so on, we were racially profiled. So, when the planes hit the building we were like, 'mmmm, justice'. And just as I began to say 'now of course a lot of our friends and family were lost there as well' but I was interrupted...\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/KRS-One\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

With the release of \"Blast Shield Down\" on Hagen's own label Purple Astonaut Records, the album garnered rave reviews being called \"the greatest acid-stoner-space-doom-rock record ever made\" by Sleazegrinder Magazine 2001. The record also made the Stonerrock.com top 20 best albums of 2001. During this time some of the memorable highlights of their live shows were Eric \"Lando\" Hagen's Weedstock 2001 shows at the Paradise Lounge in San Francisco, Ca. Those shows which included Acid King, Canyon Creep, Totimoshi, Operator Generator, Gammera and El Buzzard among others would turn into a staging place for co-headliners Greenhouse Effect to unleash their Fuzzed-out sound. With Greenhouse Effects live perormance reputation growing, the band played memorable shows with Keelhaul, Gammera, Natas (Argentina), Bongzilla, Automatic Animal, Brainoil, Jumbos Killcrance, Blessing the Hogs, The Hitch, 16, Skinlab, Sourvein, HDR, Activator, and Spaceboy among others. In 2002 the band performed at Rob Leveys Stoner Hands of Doom IV and delivered a set of music from their yet to be titled second record. A hand shake deal with Jadd from Meteor City Records right after their set would be a quick but short lived success as injuries, line-up changes and other distractions would prevent the as yet to be recorded \"Totalsonicfuzzdom\" from ever being released on Meteor City. With Lando and Jason James the only original members on board and Greg Emmley playing bass, Eric Powers (Clay Wheels) would be recruited to play drums on \"Totalsonicfuzzdom\". With Jeff Pinn engineering, Greenhouse Effect would enter Zilla Studios in South San Francisco to begin recording. With musical and personal differences as well as other distractions surfacing, the fuzzdom sessions ultimately would be cut short with Greg Emmley leaving the band and James starting a band with members of Gammera called Tusk or Soot (The Secret order of Tusk). With an invite to play Stoner Hands of Doom 5 in Portland, Ore looming, Lando finished the loose ends and mastered \"TSF\" @Soundwave Studios in Oakland, Ca. with Jim Juhn. After a short break with Lando involved in other projects and needing to recover from extreme exhaustion both mentally and physically, Greenhouse Effect would ride again. \"Totalsonicfuzzdom\" was released on Purple Astonaut Records in Sept. of 2004. Intact with a new line-up, A cd release show@Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco, Ca. with Chris Corona of Floating Goat on the other guitar would once again bring the band to the forefront. Shows with Clutch, Bottom, Crisis, BRNR, Floating Goat and Hot Black Desiato to name a few would follow. With 2005 on the horizon, and members of the band doing other projects, Lando decided to put Greenhouse Effect on the shelf. Lando would form or join several other projects during this time including Grasshopper, The Centaurs of Divine Disco, Fuzzplow and The Moons of Cronos. Greenhouse Effect would lie dormant until 2006 when an invite to play Stoner Hands of Doom 7 in Mesa, Az. would once again create an opportunity to crank up the fuzzdom... ...... Priest from BRNR would join the band on drums as well as Greg Randolph a bay area musical mastermind on bass. Greenhouse Effect would appear @SHOD 7 and 8. With re-newed energy, Lando and the Effect would then begin work on what would be Greenhouse Effects 3rd studio album \"Ants in the Afterbirth\". The record was recorded @Sonic Room Studios in Livermore, Ca. with Tim Narducci (Spiral Arms, Systematic) engineering. Released in 2007 on Purple Astronaut Records the 4-song EP was dubbed \"more stoner trickery and the best lyrics yet\" by Adam Dunn of Sludgezine. In 2008 Lando again put the band on haitus and formed another stonerrock project called White Witch Canyon with Tim \"Krete\" Narducci on drums and vocals. in 2009 Greenhouse Effect celebrated their 10 year anniversary. Album number 4 is slated to have guest appearances, more fuzz, and a few suprises. No recording date has been set. May the fuzz be with you. .... \"San Francisco\u2019s Greenhouse Effect represents the greatest of all cliches, your best entertainment value. Combining the best elements of all timeless riff-based rock music (Clutch, Soundgarden and mid-80s Black Flag come to mind, with some good old fashioned Haight Ashbury psychedelia mixed in) Greenhouse Effect continues to develop into what could someday be the West Coast\u2019s greatest underground metal band. I don\u2019t just make this stuff up. See them now and thank me later\". ....

It was formed in early 2000 by Juba Kalamka, Tim'm T. West and Phillip Atiba Goff. The three began working together after Kalamka and West met at a screening of black gay filmmaker and scholar Marlon Riggs' film Tongues Untied. Kalamka and West later met Goff on the campus of Stanford University, where West and Goff were enrolled in PhD programs.\n\nKalamka and West had been performing for years as MCs but had few opportunities to work as out queer artists until encountering each other and Goff shortly thereafter. Kalamka had begun recording an experimental spoken word project called Pre\/tensions with San Francisco blues and avantgarde jazz whiz Dick \"Deluxe\" Egner and with groundbreaking queer hip hop group Rainbow Flava, but both were interested in the possibility of creating a project that would push buttons around race, queerness and masculinity in hip hop all at once.\n\nFrustrated with the resistance they had faced from an allegedly progressive \"conscious\" spoken word scene, the three began jamming together in private on Stanford's campus and came up with the skeletons of about 20 songs, 13 of which would become their debut recording BourgieBohoPostPomoAfroHomo. In a moment of anger while discussing their difficulty with the local scene (West had been performing at readings and with bands since his arrival in 1998, but lost all of his bookings once it the scene became aware that he was gay) Kalamka blurted \"well, if them girls can call themselves the Punany Poets (a then popular Oakland poetry group), we can be Deep Dick Collective!\". The name was then shortened to \"Deep Dickollective\", but the initials \"D\/DC\" remained as the three letter abbreviation seemed to roll off the tongue well.

Hard work, high goals, and relentless determination has paved the way thus far, and continues to fuel his lifelong quest of doing what he loves to do, rap.\n\nFollowing the blueprints laid by independent gurus E-40 and JT The Bigga Figga, Kee at the age of 17, started his own record label Sticky Style Recordz and released his debut E.P. Livin' On The Ultimate High. Selling half through distribution, and the other half through self-determination, Mr. Kee's name began buzzing around the Bay Area, creating a cult-like following in the bay area and Central Valley.\n\nKee continued to build himself a name with the release of his second independent album, From The Womb To The Tomb. An album made up of Kee, his brother Sidewayz Valentino, and cousin Duke Shiesty, under the group moniker I.T.P.G. Soon after the record was released on the market, word in the industry rapidly grew. Mr. Kee's reputation for his dynamic vocal presence coupled with his in-depth story telling abilities, caught the ears of local record labels, and Kee eventually signed with the compilation powerhouse, Black-N-Brown Entertainment, becoming their first and premier solo artist.\n\nHis debut LP, 14 Kt. Dreams, which sound scanned 13,000 units, featured Mr. Kee alongside some of the Bay Area's elite, including B-Legit, 11\/5, C-Bo and Houston, Texas phenomenon, South Park Mexican. Not one to disappoint, Kee easily outshined every one of his guests, displaying the necessary creative talent, skills, and finesse to establish himself as a significant figure in the Bay Area.\n\nAfter the release of 14 Kt.

All the while, prepping the nation for Kee to unleash The Latin Plague.\n\nFor his sophomore album, fans found Mr. Kee straying away from the 'typical' Bay Area album, and big name features on The Latin Plague. Spawning hits like Tequilla Bodyshots, Nasty Mind, Hydro and It's On You. Proving he is more than capable and deserving of taking his talent nationwide and joining the illustrious ranks of the few Latin rappers to transcend all boundaries.

Khujo, whose name refers to the leader of the Tribal Maroons who led escaped slaves to freedom. Khujo also means change. If you count the letters K-H-U-J-O on the alphabet, add the numbers up and divide the total by 5, you get the number 13 which symbolizes change:\n\nK(11)+H(8)+U(21)+J(10)+O(15)=65=65\/5=13.  Not to mention his birthday falls on the 13th, therefore his name bears special meaning. This change of revolution is evident in the message that Khujo conveys throughout my conversation with him.   The member of the Goodie Mob gets deep with me as I find out how he got his start.  \u201cI like to give the most high praise to Yahweh, the God of Isaac, The God of Abraham, the most high God, I have been in the game professionally since 1994\u201d.  Since elementary school Khujo performed as one of the Pips from Glady's Knight & The Pips at Peyton Forest Elementary School talent show. He enjoyed performing in front of an audience and realized his love and talent for music. In middle school, Khujo was a member of a rap group called the \"Party Crashers,\" in which the group would literally \"crash parties.\" It wasn't until high school that Khujo began to develop and nurture his lyrical content. \n\n\"In high school, I changed what I rapped about because I was getting older and more mature and things (life) started making sense to me. I began to get conscious about the responsibilities of being a black man, and I wanted to wake my people up. I realized my purpose on earth. God's purpose. The P-Funk influence, George Clinton, and the rest helped me to realize what style influenced me.  While in high school, Khujo was a member of a six-person group called \"Six Sense,\" which included Big Gipp and Ray Murray of Organized Noize Productions. Khujo went on to form \u2018The Lumberjacks\u2019 along with T-Mo, and from there they met Cee-Lo. The rest is Goodie Mob history!, Big Limb, King Bean, Ceelo,. Rough Rugged and Raw.  Ceelo and Gip came along later.  Goodie Mob which stands for, The Good Die Mostly Over Bullshit, was made by Ceelo.  It meant that good people die over bullshit.  But, as I read more, I find that the wages of sin is death, its really not bullshit.  Its actually sin.\u201d\n\nKhujo, being a member of one of the pioneering groups, that represented the hip hop from the South, is currently set to release his own solo project, simply entitled \u201cKhujo - the Man not the dawg\u201d  The release date is May 28th, and independently distributed.  The album boasts of guest appearances by his brother \u2013 Southwest Armstrong, his cousin Mark Twayne, his homeboy, Murda, Slip Matola from the Westside, Whyld Peach, the Children of Israel and fellow Goodie mates,  Big Gipp, and T-Mo.  When asked what separates his material from a typical Goodie Mob album, he responds, Is there a separation from your music or style from the typical Goodie Mob album?  \u201cI have become a lil older, know the game a lil longer, you will get the same stuff you would get from the Goodie Mob but a whole different form.\n\nKhujo, a spiritual, humble, down to earth brother gave me his opinion on the state of the music industry:  \u201cThe consumers hear what they want to hear right now, they are calling the radio stations and requesting. It\u2019s almost time for our deliverance out of this world.  That\u2019s why we are not hearing any truths from our leaders, our religious leaders, and definitely the music.  It\u2019s the Program Directors who have the power of what is played.  For the black people who have all the money, let\u2019s get our own radio stations!  Let\u2019s make this change! Some radio stations diving into the payola issue and got people paying $25,000 to get your music played on the radio.  That\u2019s why I want to do the independent thing,  For instance, Houston TX, and the whole area is wide open for independents, it has a wide open market\u201d\n\n \n\nIn the age of technology now music is now being downloaded and some even before the release dates (a new form of bootlegging) do you feel there is a proposed solution for this ?   Khujo confesses that \u201cIf you do everything in house, you may slow down the process, but now there are computers and Pro tools, Cakewalk, and other programs, now if you go to the big studios you are letting them cats have ample time to do what they want to do with your product.  I don\u2019t think there is a way to get around it.\u201d\n\nBeing that we focus on good resources and advice for up and coming artists, we had to ask Khujo what his tips were for the aspiring artists.  Khujo\u2019s lends advice for independents and people who feel they have a good marketable product, \u201cIn my eyes, if you got a hot song, get you some wax printed up. Then go to a club that is accessible to the type of music you are doing.  Get a relationship with a DJ and then deliver it to them, and let it bubble in the underground, and soon there will be a demand for your product.  Basically its who you know that will get you in there and What you know that will keep you in there.\u201d\n\nCurrently in the advent of the South rising again, the music industry has embraced southern artists and \u201ccountry\u201d slang and grammar, they feel that the hottest artists at the moment are coming from the south, and therefore are in the process of capitalizing on the marketability, when asking Khujo about this new interest in his home region his response was: \u201cI\u2019ll say we were founders of putting the South on the map, We had role models like Public Enemy, NWA, KRS-One, and then we mad e up our mind of what style we wanted to do, we stuck our neck out on things we believe in, and things like going to the grocery store for you momma, or what state our country is in, or whatever.  In our region before, we talked about shaking booty, or selling dope but we never had any \u2018real\u2019 everyday topics that the average person goes through\u201d\n\nKhujo is on the cusp of waking the unrighteous, enlightening the weak, delivering the masses, and delivering those spit fire lyrics as only he knows how in that well known Goodie Format.  His up coming CD, will definitely be a anticipated one, and a much needed refresher in this free thought capitalistic, socially irresponsible music industry.\"\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKhujo (Willie Knighton, Jr.) is an American hip hop musician who was born on March 13, 1972 in Atlanta, Georgia. He is one-fourth of Goodie Mob (along with T-Mo, Cee-Lo, and Big Gipp), and one-half of The Lumberjacks (with T-Mo). Khujo is a very spiritual man known for his distinct, grunty voice and free-flowing rhyming style. He rhymes about all aspects of street life, often intertwining those subject with God metaphorically or directly. In 2002 he was involved in a car crash which resulted in the amputation of his right leg below the knee.\n\nHe released his only solo album, The Man Not The Dawg, in 2002 to limited success. In it he delved into more personal, gritty topics that wouldn't have fit in the cohesive, conscious songs in the early Goodie Mob albums.\n\nIn 2008 the first tracks from his forthcoming collaboration with Jneiro Jarel appeared on internet blogs. The tracks, \"Georgiavania\" and \"In The Red\" featured production by Jneiro Jarel and vocals by Jneiro and Khujo. The group is called Willie Isz. The two artists had previously collaborated on the 2008 single \"OPR8R\" by Shape Of Broad Minds. The Willie Isz album \"Georgiavania\" is due to be released on Lex Records in April 2009.\n\nKhujo prefers to be called a messenger as opposed to a rapper, saying, \"'Cuz rappas wrap gifts.\" He belonged to the Party Crashers rap group in middle school and formed the Six Sense rap group in high school with soon-to-be Dungeon Family affiliates Ray Murray, Big Gipp, and others.\n\nWhile some mistakenly believe that Khujo's name is an adaptation of \"Cujo\" the violent dog from the popular Stephen King novel and subsequent film, it is actually a tribute to the leader of the tribal Maroons who lead escaped slaves to freedom. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Khujo+Goodie\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

A Canadian rapper and hip-hop artist with several albums (I Think Not (2008), Unknown MC (2004), Conflict of Interest (2002), & Songs From Degrassi: The Next Generation (2005)\/Various Artists.\n2. The second artist (with the same stage name) has one known album, Boxes.\n\n\n1. EVREN \n\n\"Music is the way we pray and build a connection with ourselves and the universe.\"  Evren\n\nTurkish-born and Toronto-raised MC Evren, last name Ozdemir, has cultivated a rare talent for making conscious hip hop feel hood savvy over a twenty-year career as a songwriter, producer and composer. Evren\u2019s more than 70 meticulously crafted tracks have appeared on three independent discs: 2002's Conflict of Interest, 2004's internationally acclaimed Unknown MC and 2008's I Think Not. His song writing genius has earned him musical credits on the popular television shows Instant Star, Degrassi - The Next Generation (he co-write the theme song), Billable Hours and The Best Years. He has also earned industry credits for compositions featured in national marketing campaigns by Toyota (including the spontaneous-party-inspiring \u201cDo I Go\u201d 2009 Matrix commercial), TELUS, Nike and Kellogg's. His most recent accolade:  A prize at the 2010 Eurovision Song Writing competition for \u201cWe Could Be the Same,\u201d performed by Turkish super group maNaga.\n\n\tThe fourth EP, 2010\u2019S A Little Bit of Love, is much anticipated by the Toronto hip hop community. The album features Evren\u2019s unique soundscape, blending the analogue: Torrie Seager on guitar, Jonny Cooper on bass and Dean Elliot on drums, and the grindy bass back beats, synth tunes and samples characteristic the digital hip hop domain. \n\n\tA Little Bit of Love is another compositional feat by Evren, who has an enviable natural ability to organize many layers of seemingly dichotomous sounds, which derive from many different sonic and cultural sources (like Turkish belly dancing tunes and street noise), into a relevant and comprehensible audio masterpiece.\n\n\"I feel this EP is a true reflection of where I am right now musically,\u201d Evren says, \u201cThe songs just came so naturally and there's a great, relaxed vibe running through the record\u2026 I can\u2019t wait to get out and play these songs.\u201d\n\n\tA Little Bit of Love also pushes the boundaries between the pop rock and hip hop genres. Fusing Evren's ambidextrous lyrical rhetoric and perfectionist rhythmic arrangements of the synth, keyboards, pads and vocals with the sunshine falsetto harmony of Courteney Brooks, Evren's musical landscape creates an exciting emotional space that draws you in with its evocative imagery and its innovative blend of unique and authentic sounds. Evren keeps you glued to your iPod because you are compelled to his fiery persona and righteous flow and feel both uplifted and vindicated by his messages. \n\n\tBringing a wealth of personal wisdom from a soul that's lived beyond his 32 years, Evren inflects his lyrics with his tenacious spirit and supports his smooth vocals with textured arrangements that rouse you, lull you, hype you, inspire you or encourage you to \u2018shine\u2019. Each track is a snapshot of a different fragment of his life, places where he\u2019s been, and with each album he comes a little bit closer to putting the whole story together. \n\n\tEvren intelligently expresses a passionate view on topics that reflect the breadth of his maturity as an artist and as a regular guy, with a history, just trying to get by. Anti-establishment, anti-violence and pro-humanity are common themes as he attacks the social stratum, governmental dictates and hip hop ideals that perpetuate violence, blind posturing, commoditization and anti- individuation. He is equally brilliant at \u2018bringing the fire\u2019 or inspiring you to reflect and love. \n\n\u201cMusic saves me,\u201d Evren confesses, \u201cWriting is my passion\u2026 I\u2019m not just the straight hip hop head. I want to be a better person. I\u2019ll keep getting it out there because I enjoy people embracing a message.\"  With the admirable creative genius of his ability to predict, interpret and extend the hip hop industry\u2019s emerging production techniques and an impressive cache of rock solid powerhouse tracks, Evren is what the Toronto hip hop community has been praying for-- and it doesn\u2019t hurt that he looks damn good performing and loves what he does.\n\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.myspace.com\/evrenmusic  \nhttp:\/\/evrenmusic.com\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Evren\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The original group members were lead MC Mr. Cheeks, backup MC and hypeman Freaky Tah, DJ Spigg Nice and Pretty Lou.\n \nIn 1995, the group released their debut single \"Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless\", charting on the Billboard Hot 100. The release landed them a record deal with Uptown Records. The group contributed a single to the Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood soundtrack, titled \"Renee\". The song became a major hit, breaking into the Top 40 on the Hot 100 chart. The single also reached Gold status in 1996. On June 4, 1996, they released their debut album Legal Drug Money. The work was highly acclaimed, and the album featured five Billboard Hot 100 hits, including their past singles \"Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless\", \"Renee\", as well as \"Music Makes Me High\", \"Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz & Benz\" and \"Get Up\". The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1996. Their second album, Love, Peace & Nappiness, was released on June 17, 1997 on Uptown\/Universal Records. It featured another Hot 100 hit single, \"Me & My Crazy World\". One of the most famous songs on the album was the posse-cut \"Beasts From The East\", featuring A+, Redman and Canibus. The album wasn't as acclaimed as their debut, but fared well commercially, reaching Gold status in late 1997.\n\nLost Boyz called it a day in '99. On the night of March 28, 1999, at a birthday party for Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tah was shot in the head while exiting the Sheraton Hotel in Queens. Tah was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 4:20 am, at the age of 27. The getaway driver, Raheem Fletcher, was sentenced to 7 years in prison for Manslaughter. In 2001, Kelvin Jones pleaded guilty to the murder. The three remaining group members finished their third album LB IV Life, released in September 1999. The effort fell short critically and commercially, failing to provide any Hot 100 hits, and failing to reach Gold status. The three split-up after the release, and lead MC Mr. Cheeks began a solo career. He released his first solo effort John P. Kelly in 2001, which featured the smash hit \"Lights, Camera, Action!\". The album also featured a heartfelt tribute song to Freaky Tah, titled \"Till We Meet Again\", featuring Bob Marley's son Stephen. Cheeks released another album in 2003, titled Back Again!, then followed in 2004 with Ladies & Ghettomen. On January 16, 2004, DJ Spigg Nice was tried and convicted of multiple bank robberies in New Jersey and was sentenced to 37 years in prison.

Consisting of two veteran MCs and a DJ, the Dodgers have been gaining recognition throughout the Midwest for years. By incorporating several different genres of music into their production, and mixing complex lyrics with innovative deliveries, they have created their own unique style of Hip-Hop.\nThe founding members Brady \"B.Gozza\" Gasser and Rex \"Jackpot\" Demski began recording and performing in the early nineties. In 1994 they collaborated with other local rappers and producer Phizyx to release a successful single under the collective name \"The Juggernaut\". Enjoying success at retail and receiving critical acclaim, the group toured the Midwest until disbanding in 1996. Shortly after, B.Gozza and Jackpot began working again as the Artfull Dodgers. In 1997 they released the EP entitled \"Dusted World\", with Phizyx returning on the production. The Dodgers wasted no time and started performing again throughout Michigan.\n\nFrom 1998-1999 the Dodgers completed their first full-length album, \"Lazy Eyes\". Collaborating with well-established producer Pharlon \"Bangtown\" Randle, the 12 song LP was a creative masterpiece that spoke out to the global Hip-Hop scene. The album received critical acclaim and opened many doors for the Dodgers. The single \"One Mic Then Pass\", quickly became an underground classic throughout the Midwest. The song also became the Dodgers' first music video, and received steady rotation on many independent video shows. The Dodgers continued to perform all over the Midwest in clubs and arenas, and have shared the stage with such industry heavyweights as Killah Priest and Cappadonna of the Wu Tang Clan, Too Short, Petey Pablo, and Eminem as well as headlining many of their own shows.\n\n2001 was an exceptional year for the Dodgers. After picking up a pressing and distribution deal through Chicago's Aeemp Records, they released a new single called \"Laced\" and began working on their sophomore album. The Dodgers also added a new member to their roster this year, Jake \"DJ Sir Real\" Greba, formerly of Detroit's Howling Diablos. Sir Real had previous experience working with the Dodgers and became a powerful addition to the group. The Dodgers traveled the country touring, and recorded the new album in various studios with multiple producers to accomodate the experimental feel of the album.\n\nIn 2002 the sophomore album \"Second Wind\" was unleashed. The 22-song LP was an achievement, and elevated the Dodgers into the underground elite. Collaborating with a variety of talented producers and the likes of Killah Priest and underground legend J.U.I.C.E, the album secured the Dodgers spot among the most promising of independent Hip-Hop artists. \"Second Wind\" and the lead single \"Still Writing Rhymes\" quickly became classics in the Midwest. Success on College radio and astounding critical praise continues to elevate the album. \"Second Wind\" even received the prestigious \"Album of the Year Award\" from Detroitrap.com at their Hip-Hop Awards Show.\n\nIn 2004 the Dodgers went on the road with the Vans Warped Tour performing on the Code Of Tha Cutz Stage. The tour was a huge success with record setting attendance at the Detroit stop. More tours are in the works as well as the Dodgers debut in Europe. A second Artfull Dodgers' film is currently in production.\n\nIn 2006 the Dodgers completed \"Off The Credenza\", their most artistic and complex album yet. The album was picked up by Silent Records out of Detroit Michigan and is set to be released on September 11, 2007. 2006 also marked yet another change in the Dodgers' roster with DJ Sir Real leaving the group to pursue a career as a solo DJ. Shortly after, longtime friend and collaborater DJ Zack Daniels joined up with the Dodgers taking over full time DJ duties. A fourth Artfull Dodgers full length album with DJ Zack and DJ Psycho is currently in production.\n\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Artfull+Dodgers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Their music falls loosely under the heading of \"pop\" but is really a unique blend of many musical styles such as rock, folk, latin, country and swing. The music is very upbeat, saturated with extremely catchy hooks and lyrics that often tell stories with a decidedly \"tongue in cheek\" flare. At times it sounds a little \"retro\" but at others much more contemporary. Groups that have been influential to their style are Barenaked Ladies, Dave Matthews, XTC, The Beatles, Crowded House, They Might Be Giants and Elvis Costello, just to name a few. Their music's energy seems to jump right off their CDs as you play them. You're gonna want to use this in place of any of those antidepressants you've been taking! THIS music is the antidote to all of that dark, angst ridden, brooding and whiney music you will find out there today without becoming overly sentimental or sappy. MADHOUSE is just plain FUN!!! The band's live shows are quite a spectacle to behold, with loads of antics, props and peculiar dance moves. These guys are not just musicians...they are entertainers!

Continually redefining themselves through their frenetic touring schedule, while stamping their name on acclaimed singles and two full length albums, Resin Dogs are established as one of Australia\u2019s most successful bands of recent times.\n\nFrom humble beginnings in 1996, the teaming of DJ Katch, Geoff (Jigsaw) Boardman, Dave Atkins and Chris Bosley quickly proved a unique formula. Crowds grew and continued to swell with their early shows at Ric\u2019s and The Zoo, in Brisbane\u2019s Fortitude Valley, establishing the band\u2019s unquestionable credentials. The sound - an undeniably hot blending of cut and paste sampling, funk, hip hop, breakbeat, and frenetic live playing.\n\nThey quickly attracted label attention as venues filled and their first independent releases were snapped up by punters in huge numbers across Australia. In 2000 they signed with Virgin\/ EMI for their debut album release in a dual deal along with their own label Hydrofunk. A force in its own right, Hydrofunk is the established base for the many Resin Dogs side projects and responsible for releasing the band\u2019s 2003 follow up full length Hi Fidelity Dirt.\n\nThe band\u2019s two albums Grand Theft Audio and Hi Fidelity Dirt continue to attract strong sales and widespread praise from critics and fans. Vinyl sales of Grand Theft Audio grow every year as it becomes a favourite of DJs across the globe.\n\nThe Resin Dogs line up doesn't stop with its four core members. There are a number of co-conspirators who join the band for their live events and studio sessions. MC DNO (Shin Ki Row, Decipher), percussionist Peter Neville (Trout fishing In Quebec), and an impressive line up of guest breakers, MC\u2019s and live players make any Resin Dogs show \u2018an experience\u2019 and their recordings so highly prized.\n\nResin Dogs scooped three Australian Dance Music Awards - Best Hip Hop Act 2001 and Best Live Act back to back 2002 and 2003. In 2004 the band was Ambassador of the largest celebration on Australia\u2019s youth calendar - National Youth Week.\n\nResin Dogs have blitzed every major Australian festival year after year. Testament to the popularity and sheer talent of the band Resin Dogs have played Livid, Meredith, Woodford and Blues & Roots Music Festivals (to name just a few) and in a huge feat Big Day Out for seven years. Organisers of Meredith Music Festival said of Resin Dogs performance \u201c\u2026the best 90 minutes of live groove ever seen in the bush\u201d.\n\nThe band\u2019s collaborations and recordings feature the very best that Australia, and the world has to offer. Too many to list, the highlights would have to include the likes of DJ Ransom, Ben Ely (Regurgitator), Abstract Rude (Abstract Tribe Unique), Lazy Grey, Robert Reed (Trouble Funk), Mad Doctor X, Kenny Dope, Super Dense Child and most recently The Pharcyde, Jungle Brothers and the immense talents of the UK\u2019s Spikey Tee. An invitation from Black Eyed Peas saw Resin Dogs support the band on their Australian tour in October 2004.\n\nA triumphant appearance at the world\u2019s largest WOMAD Festival at Rivermead in England and a sell-out show at London\u2019s favourite club Cargo, which has seen many of the world\u2019s finest DJs, signals the start of the push to play internationally for the band.\n\nHaving performed sell-out concerts across Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the UK, Resin Dogs are focused on showing the world the best that Australia has to offer.

Kardinal blends soul, dancehall, reggae and hip-hop to create a truly unique sound.\n\nKardinal started rapping at the age of eight, and was winning competitions by the time he was 12. Also at the age of 12, Kardinal performed live and on stage for the first time, with Nelson Mandela in attendance during his first visit to Toronto.[2] By 1993, he decided to drop his alias \"KoolAid\", and went by the moniker Kardinal Offishall after being inspired by the great 17th century French politician Cardinal Richelieu.\n\nKardinal was signed to a publishing deal with Warner\/Chappell Music Canada at the age of 20. In 1996, he released his first single \"Naughty Dread\", which was featured on the Rap Essentials Volume One compilation and earned him a Juno Award nomination for Best Rap Recording. In 1997, Kardinal released his debut album Eye & I on Capitol Hill Music. The only single from the album, \"On Wit Da Show\", had considerable video play on MuchMusic. Kardinal was also credited as a major contributor to the late 90's renaissance of Canadian hip hop. In 1998, he was featured on the Juno-winning single \"Northern Touch\" with the Rascalz, Choclair, Checkmate and Thrust.\n\nIn 2000, Kardinal signed with MCA Records. He released the album Quest for Fire: Firestarter, Vol. 1 in 2001, which spawned the hits \"BaKardi Slang\" and \"Ol' Time Killin'\". The album earned a gold certification in Canada. After MCA folded in 2003, Kardinal's highly anticipated follow up album Firestarter Vol. 2: F Word Theory was shelved along with the single\/video for \"Belly Dancer\" featuring Pharrell, and Kardinal eventually found himself without a label. Had the album been released, there would have been production from Timbaland and The Neptunes among others. He released an independent mixtape titled Kill Bloodclott Bill in 2004 with his production company, The Black Jays, and he also released his second major-label album titled Fire and Glory in 2005, through Virgin Records in Canada only. Hits on Fire and Glory include \"Everyday (Rudebwoy)\" and \"Heads Up\".\n\nKardinal has also produced many songs, including the hit single \"Let's Ride\" by Choclair, whose album Ice Cold went gold in 35 days and would win them a Juno in 2000. However, it was with the Black Jays team when Kardinal received notoriety for his production work. In 2004, Kardinal and Solitair of the Black Jays created a remix version of Jay-Z's The Black Album and called it The Black Jays Album. Kardinal also did some production on Kill Bloodcott Bill and produced 9.5 out of the 14 tracks on Fire and Glory.\n\nHe is one of the few Canadian hip hop artists that have an international audience and has collaborated with artists such as Busta Rhymes, Method Man, Sean Paul, Spragga Benz, Bounty Killer, Little Brother, Stat Quo, Pharoahe Monch, Vybz Kartel, Rihanna, Snow, Pete Rock, Lil Wayne and Akon. A-List producers, The Neptunes requested Kardinal appear on the remix to their smash hit production \u201cGrindin'\u201d with Clipse. The remix was well received across North America, particularly in New York City.\n\nTo date, Kardinal is the only Canadian urban act to appear on BET\u2019s Rap City (even freestyling in the booth with Big Tigger), and on MTV\u2019s Advance Warning (which introduces the world to artists on the verge of breaking big, like former guest Kanye West). Kardinal has made brief guest appearances in Rihanna's \"Pon De Replay\" music video, and Sean Paul's \"Get Busy\" video, which was shot in Woodbridge, Ontario (a Toronto suburb). He has also appeared on mixtapes from Clinton Sparks and DJ Green Lantern.\n\nIn 2006, Kardinal collaborated Akon, Cipha Sounds, DJ Whoo Kid, and various members of the Black Jays family among others. At the 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards, Kardinal walked away with 3 awards for \"Everyday (Rudebwoy)\", including Best Video, Best Director (RT!) and VideoFACT Award. At the MMVA's, he announced that he had an upcoming collaboration with the Canadian Reggae Band Bedouin Soundclash, now known as the single \"Last Standing Soldier\" (Remix).\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kardinal+Offishall\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Francis uses a broad emotional palette to address a wide range of personal, cultural, and political issues. His unconventional style and persona have given him crossover appeal, but at the same time alienated some hip-hop listeners. \n\nPrior to embarking on a full-time career as an MC, Francis displayed his skills in slam poetry. During the late 1990s, he recorded his first demo tape (1996), fronted the now defunct Providence hip-hop band Art Official Intelligence, and hosted a weekly slot on independent radio station WRIU (the \"True School Session\"). He also formed the Non-Prophets and released a 12\u201d (Drop Bass\/Bounce\/I Keep Calling, Emerge Records, 1999), following up in 2003 with their first full-length offering, Hope. Francis is a contemporary of underground hip-hop artists such as Slug, Eyedea, Sole and the anticon. collective. He is also loosely affiliated with the vague underground hip-hop super-group The Orphanage.\n\nAs a solo performer, Francis won the MC battle at the 2000 Scribble Jam, and in 2001 he came close to repeating as champion (semi-finalist) while performing as his \"metal\" alter ego, \"Xaul Zan\". Francis released his first proper solo album, Personal Journals, on Anticon. in 2002. He toured with a live band on the Live Band Dead Poet Tour to support it. Francis subsequently became the first hip-hop artist to sign with Punk label Epitaph, agreeing to a three-album deal. His first album for Epitaph, A Healthy Distrust, was released in early 2005 and was followed up with Human the Death Dance in 2007.\n\nOne of Francis' best-known tracks is \"Makeshift Patriot\", a commentary on the American media recorded one month after the September 11, 2001 attacks which he released on the internet as an MP3 as well as a limited edition 7\" single.\n\nIn February 2005 Sage dropped his second full length album on the originally punk label Epitaph, it was widely regarded as the best underground hip hop album of the year by critics and fans alike and featured heavily political tracks such as \"The Buzz Kill\" and \"Slow Down Gandhi\" and more personal material like that more similar to that of his debut 'Personal Journals' such as 'Bridle' and a few heavily satirical comments on the modern day rap and urban scene such as the satirical comment on youth gun culture 'Gunz Yo'.\n\nSage has helped to set up the Wiki KnowMore.org which is described as a 'way to keep tabs on the some of the biggest and most dangerous businesses in the world'. He is a vegetarian and also chooses to abstain from drugs and drinking, though doesn't label himself as \"straight-edge\" because he believes \"you shouldn't define yourself by what you don't do.\" \n\nSage has set up his own label and signed some of who he claims to be his favorite artists of the moment such as Buck 65 and Proplyphic and Reanimator named Strange Famous (which shares his initials) with which he released his most recent work 'Human the Death Dance'\n\nThis album was released in May 2007 and takes a step away from the heavily political 'Healthy Distrust' and heads back to the more personal lyrics of 'Personal Journals' and comments on modern culture. The album features cameos from many Strange Famous artists such as Buddy Wakefield, Buck 65 and Reanimator.\n\nIn 2010 Sage released his fourth full length album Li(f)e (the title coming from the famous quote from 'The Cure' on the Non-Prophets album Hope \"Life is just a lie with an f in it and death is definite\"). The album was extremely well received and one particular single off of the album 'The Best Of Times' received extensive air play on the popular British radio station Radio 1. After Sages Li(f)e tour Sage has stated that he will no longer be doing tours but will still be releasing albums and other materials, instead he will be doing select gigs throughout each year.\n\nOn 3 June 2014, Sage released his fifth studio album 'Copper Gone'. It is the first official studio album after Sage Francis announced his hiatus, which lasted for four years.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sage+Francis\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Although the album never got released, leaks prompted this album to become the most bootlegged album in 209\u2019s history with its presents being found in Canada, Germany, and across the U.S. 1996-97 - With the help of Indoja Records, Doja Clik releases thier first studio album entitled \u201cSpeed Kills\u201d. In this release two new members are introduced; Mr. Peebodie and Nasty Trey. This album featured Bay Area heavyweights such as JT the Bigga Figga, San Quinn, Guce and Merced rapper Young Droop. Having major promotion in Murder Dog magazine, 4080, Lowrider, Illtip Mag, Showcase, tours across the U.S., and video with E-40\u2019s sister Suga T., pushed \u201cSpeed Kills\u201d to sell over 40,000 units. 1998-99 - Young Ren releases first solo project entitled \u201cUndaground Mailroad\u201d. Mr. Peebodie also drops his First solo \u201cMake it Happen\u201d. 2001 - Doja Clik releases \u201cTHC\u201d and introduces member Antidote. Going back to roots, \u201cTHC\u201d is entirely recorded on an 8 track. Getting back to the underground feel, this album displays lyrical styles and addresses political issues. Sales are good but by far overshadowed by the success of \u201cSpeed Kills\u201d. 2006 \u2013 Young Ren decides start a new label, Heatrock Records. \u201cThe Best of Doja Clik\u201d is released under the new Heatrock Records label to stamp out the past, and mark a new beginning for the group. 2009 \u2013 Heatrock Records and Chicken Hill Productions come together to give us \u201cDoja Clik present\u2019s Ren da Heatmonsta\u201d in \u201cda Mudville King\u201d (Young Ren\u2019s second solo release album now with a name change, from \u201cYoung Ren\u201d to \u201cRen da Heatmonsta\u201d).

He is most renown for his style of rapping he refers to as \"white trash\", that talks about growing up white, poor, and in the South.\n\nEarly life\n\nHaystak was born to teenage parents, raised by his grandmother, and grew up in the poorest environment. As he got older, Haystak began engaging in a life of crime. But all that ended after being arrested on charges of drug possession at the age of 15.[citation needed]\n\n\nMusic\n\nHaystak began rapping after being released two years later, but no one gave him the chance to prove himself. So Haystak took a daring chance and joined a local label called Street Flava Records and producers Kevin Grisham and Sonny Paradise. They produced his debut album, Mak Million, in 1998. With his description of the southern way of life from a white boy's point of view, Haystak won the respect of his peers in the underground rap scene and was recognized by the people of Nashville, both white and black. Two years later, Car Fulla White Boys came out with many fans waiting eagerly. With his success, Koch Records signed Haystak and rereleased Car Fulla White Boys that same year. In 2002, Haystak's third album, The Natural, was released on Koch. Since then, Haystak's fame has grown greatly, and he even played a small role in the 2005 film Hustle and Flow.\n\nDiscography:\n\nYear    Album Title\n1998    Mak Million\n2000    Car Fulla White Boys\n2002    The Natural\n2003    Return Of The Mak Million\n2004    Portrait Of A White Boy\n2005    From Start to Finish\n2005    The New South\n2006    The Southwest Connection\n2007    Crackavelli\n2008    Hard 2 Love\n2008    Cracks The Safe\n2009    The Natural II\n2009    Came Along Way\n2010    Easy 2 Hate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Haystak\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Initially known as the Rusty Pelicans after forming in 1995, its membership currently consists of Phantom Channel (MC), Count Classic (MC), S Watson (production), and Madhatter (DJ).\n\nThe story of the Rusty Ps begins in 1982 when S Watson attended kindergarten with the Phantom Channel. The two attended Neskara Elementary in Milwaukee, WI, for their first year of school. Watson, an import to Milwaukee from Chicago and Channel a Milwaukee native became good friends right off the bat but parted ways after this first year of school.\n\nFrom there, Phantom Channel went on to attend school with the Count Classic. It was first grade at St. Sebastian's in Milwaukee. Count Classic soon moved to Madison WI.\n\nPhantom Channel, remaining at \"Sebs\" for the rest of his grade school education soon reunited with S Watson in the 6th grade as Watson began attending St Sebastian\u2019s as well. They finished their elementary education there and parted ways for different high schools.\n\nCount Classic returned from Madison and attended Nicolet High School. There he met Oneself and continued at Nicolet for his entire high school education.\n\nOneself, having left Nicolet after the first two years of high school, attended West Division High School. There he met Phantom Channel and Dana Coppafeel who had been attending that school since freshman year. Oneself reunited Channel with Classic, the old friends from first grade. They all graduated from their respective schools in 1995 and Phantom Channel and Mr. Smith went on to move into an apartment with their good friend Count Classic.\n\nAlready music lovers and hip hop \"heads\" the four, Classic, Channel, Oneself and Coppafeel, remained friends and having learned much of the culture of hip hop in high school began small freestyle sessions with other local aspiring rappers and also invested in a small beat machine, the DR-5. Meanwhile, S Watson went on to attend the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. He left school after approximately 6 months and returned home.\n\nWith out any connections in Milwaukee, Watson called his old friend Phantom Channel and began hanging out with who would soon become the Rusty Pelicans. Watson remained in Milwaukee for 6 months and went on to attend a recording arts school, Full Sail, in Winter Park, FL.\n\nIt was during this time, 1996, that the Rusty Pelicans were taking shape in a basement apartment on Milwaukee's east side.\n\nFree tracks can be downloaded at their offical website, www.rustyps.com. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/Rusty+Ps\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Townes (born January 22, 1965 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), also known as DJ Jazzy Jeff, is an American hip hop and R&B record producer and turntablist. He is best known for his early career with Will Smith as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. DJ Jazzy Jeff graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia where he is enshrined in the school's \"Wall of Fame\".\n\nHistory\n\nWhen he was growing up, he found that listening to his parents was unbearable. He got a job as a newspaper boy at age 7 to support his family. Once he grew up, he developed a reputation and following as a school and block party DJ extraordinaire, Jazzy Jeff was the feature of the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. As a duo, they had several gold and platinum-selling albums and singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, earning them the first rap Grammy ever presented in 1989 for Parents Just Don't Understand. When Smith branched out into television with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Jazzy Jeff played a recurring character named \"Jazz\", Smith's best friend on the show. The two characters always greeted each other with their signature handshake (swinging mid-five, point-back\/snap with both characters saying \"Pssh!\").\n\nJazz' trademarks include being physically ejected from the house by Uncle Phil (James Avery), screaming as he went flying out the front door. This was referenced in the song \"N.Y, N.Y.\" by Lloyd Banks from his second album Rotten Apple, with the lyric \"I throw a bitch out the crib like Jazzy Jeff\". [1]\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff is not to be confused with Jeffrey Myree from the earlier hip hop group Funky Four Plus One, which in fact filed and won a lawsuit over the name Jazzy Jeff against Jeff Townes and Jive records when they signed DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. After DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince broke up, Townes went on to become a prominent R&B, soul, and neo soul record producer, establishing the A Touch of Jazz production company in his native Philadelphia. Among the artists that Jazzy Jeff has helped develop are Jill Scott and Musiq. Even though he separated from Will Smith as music partners, they are still best friends and still occasionally work together. Some songs by Will Smith were produced by Jeff Townes (Ex. Here He Comes), and he has performed on some songs by Will Smith such as \"So Fresh\" and \"Potnas\". In addition, he appears in several of Smith's music videos such as \"Will2K\", \"Freakin' It\", and \"Party Starter\". On some occasions, he makes appearances with Smith on live concerts, producing DJ scratches.\n\nHe, along with DJ Cash Money, is credited with making the transform scratch famous.\n\nOn July 2, 2005, DJ Jazzy Jeff performed with Will Smith at the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. In the past, Will has performed on concerts with DJ Jazzy Jeff for the scratches. Moreover, Will acknowledges him in his music like \"Comin' To The Stage\" from the album Lost & Found or \"Potnas\" in his album Willennium.\n\nHis 2007 release TROTM (The Return of the Magnificent) is a classic work which returns to the roots of hip-hop with a neo-soul mixture included. This album featured numerous collaborations with old school and new school artists including CL Smooth, Big Daddy Kane, Pos from De La Soul, Method Man, Peedi Crakk (a remake of Brand New Funk), Rhymefest, and Raheem DeVaughn.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared with Rhymefest in the video DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Fest directed by Konee Rok, in which he makes music in his home recording studio with Rhymefest and they reveal that they are working on an album together called \"I'm the DJ, I'm the Rapper\".\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\n      Solo work as DJ Jazzy Jeff\n\n    * Unreleased album from Sony Records (1998)\n    * One cut in Battle of DJs\n    * The Magnificent (2002)\n    * Soulheaven Presents Jazzy Jeff in the House (2004)\n    * The Soul Mixtape Groovin' Records USA (2005)\n    * Hip-Hop Forever II Rapster Records (2004)\n    * Hip-Hop Forever III BBE Records (2006)\n    * The Return of The Magnificent EP (2007)\n    * The Return of the Magnificent (2007)\n    * The Return of Hip Hop EP (2007)\n\n\n      As DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince\n\n    * Rock the House (1987) #83 US (Gold)\n    * He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper (1988) #4 US (3x Platinum)\n    * And in This Corner\u2026 (1989) #39 US (Gold)\n    * Homebase (1991) #12 US (Platinum)\n    * Code Red (1993) #64 US (Gold)\n    * Greatest Hits (1998) #144 US, #20 UK\n    * Before The Willennium (1999)\n    * The Very Best of D.J.

The first is an English band with post rock influences, the second an American math rock band. \n\n1) Caesura formed in Winchester, south England in late 2005. They played some shows, recorded an EP (Dear Light Outside, released on Lockjaw records) and later two other tracks, one of which (Weight and Carriage) found its way onto the BSM 6machine compilation. In Autumn '08 they brought another member into the fold, and decided a change was needed. They are interested in history. They are interested in the Rosenbergs. It sort of made sense. They can now be found under the name On Histories of Rosenberg. Their first EP is due out August 09.\n\n2) A trio from San Francisco that consisted of guitar, bass, drums, and vocals, Caesura played unique, scattershot rock, the spirit of which is lodged firmly in the punk rock tradition of bands such as Mission of Burma, Gang of Four, and the Minutemen. Caesura worked diligently during its existence to solidify its sound, which has emerged as tight, slashing and bass-driven, with strong, confident vocals.\nBrad Purvis - Bass\nEvan Rehill - Guitar, voice\nMike Shoun - Drums\n\n3) Caesura are a young Exeter (South West England) based Metal band with influences from all areas of the mighty Metal Genre! Fusing groovy drum beats and bass-lines with catchy, yet still crushingly heavy, guitar riffs and brutal vocals. Caesura started out in July 2009 with Ed (Vocals), Damo (Guitar) and Jack (Guitar) and began writing material , Andy (Bass) and Toby (Drums) were quickly recruited and thus Caesura was complete.\nCaesura played their first gig on 17th May 2010 at Exeter Cavern. And continued to gig around the local area with some great bands and a metal hungry crowd. After putting on many energetic shows, making sure the crowd gets involved, The ball has started to roll after six months of gigging around Devon.\nIn April 2011 Caesura parted with Jack and Toby and the positions were filled by Gary (Drums) and Alex (Guitar). On 17th June 'The Storm' was unleashed on the public via Phonic FM. Then released as a free download!! The second half of 2011 will see Caesura record a full E.P with t-shirts and other merch' to go with it. And of course more gigging!\n\n4) A screamo band with influences from Orchid, Neil Perry, etc. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Caesura\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

While Nilla Pizzi was the Queen.\nBut the baby-boomer generation disliked more  and more his genre, style  and virtuosisms (the long acute Grand Finale - e.g., notable in \u201cGranada\u201d -, bringing a stereotype operatic flavour into traditional pop or easy listening \u201cmusica leggera\u201d).  Sharp age divisions therefore emerged, so as to make music tastes become an  identitarian, Weltanschaung space of generational divide, at the time of  \u201850s rock (with Little Tony, Italy\u2019s Elvis), then the \u201860s new pop (many thousands of cave bands, also in Italy). All this was not so specially Italian, of course; but, because of his so long career, Claudio became a target symbol (for the ritual \u201cparricide\u201d); he was gradually ghettoed into an ageing but always faithful audience (no empty space at his concerts). On the other hand, he basically sticked to his 1950s repertoire and style.\nTogether with Domenico Modugno, he holds the record for the most wins at the Sanremo Music Festival, where he won the competition in 1955 (Buongiorno tristezza), 1957 (Corde della mia chitarra), 1962 (Addio ... addio) and 1967 (Non pensare a me). He won the RAI-TV Canzonissima competition in 1964 with \" \u2018O sole mio\", and in 1966 with \"Granada\".\nHis debut was as a follower of the folk singer Carlo Buti (Florence 1902-1963, \u201cthe Golden Voice of Italy\u201d); in 1947 he records his first 78 giri record (a rarity now) and in 1952 he is the main actor in the movie \u201cSerenata amara\u201d dir. by Pino Mercanti - followed by about 30 movies, where he is often singing as well; he most loved the Mario Valli character, an artist in \u201cGranada Addio\u201d (1966) dir. by Marino Girolami.\nIn the 1950s, together with his archi-rival Luciano Tajoli, he interpreted even many songs that will almost disappear afterward: \"Il Ponte\", \"La luna nel rio\" (Who threw the moon in the river, who threw it ...) and  \"Fontane Romane\". Among Claudio Villa\u2019s classics, one shoud also mention: 1948 Scalinatella, 1949 Fontana di Trevi  and Signorinella, 1950 Luna Rossa, the 1951 Neapolitan suite (Voce 'e notte - Core 'ngrato - 'Na sera 'e maggio - Anema e core -  Malafemmena -  Munasterio 'e Santa Chiara - Marechiaro), 1951 I\u2019 te vurria vas\u00e0, 1952 Vola colomba and Vecchio scarpone, 1955 Arrivederci Roma, 1956 Guaglione, 1957 Corde della mia chitarra, Lazzarella, La vie en rose, and Ave Maria di Schubert, 1958 Nel blu dipinto di blu (Modugno\u2019s Volare), 1960 Romantica and Marina, 1969 Strangers in the night, 1974 Michelle and La Paloma, 1980 Dove sta Zaz\u00e0 and Tamurriata nera, 1982 El Condor pasa,  1985 Nessun dorma, and Caro amore (Concerto per Aranjuez).\nIn 1973 he interprets unforgettably  on TV some \u201cstornelli a dispetto\u201d in duet with the great folksinger Gabriella Ferri, his great admirer and friend. After different labels, he ended up recording with Cetra (later on becoming Fonit-Cetra).\nHis death in 1987 by heart attack was announced live on Italian television by Pippo Baudo, during the last night of the Sanremo Music Festival of 1987.\nHe recorded across 4 decades over 3000 songs, and sold over 45 million records. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Claudio+Villa\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

He is often referred to as the \"King of the Mambo\".\n\nP\u00e9rez was actually his surname, he became known by the paternal and maternal surnames \"P\u00e9rez Prado.\"\nHis orchestra was the most popular in mambo. His son, P\u00e9rez Prado, Jr., continues to direct the P\u00e9rez Prado Orchestra in Mexico City to this day.\nPerez was born in Matanzas, Cuba, his mother Sara Prado was a school teacher, his father Pablo P\u00e9rez a journalist at El Heraldo de Cuba. He studied classical piano in his early childhood, and later played organ and piano in local clubs. For a time, he was pianist and arranger for the Sonora Matancera, Cuba's best-known musical group. He also worked with casino orchestras in Havana for most of the 1940s, and gained a reputation for being an imaginative (his solo playing style predated bebop by at least five years), loud player. He was nicknamed \"El Cara de Foca\" (\"Seal Face\") by his peers at the time.\nIn 1948 he moved to Mexico to form his own band and record for RCA Victor. He quickly specialized in mambos, an upbeat adaptation of the Cuban danz\u00f3n. Perez's mambos stood out among the competition, with their fiery brass riffs and strong saxophone counterpoints, and most of all, P\u00e9rez's trademark grunts (he actually says \"\u00a1Dilo!\", or \"Say it!\", in many of the perceived grunts). In 1950 arranger Sonny Burke heard \"Que rico el mambo\" while on vacation in Mexico and recorded it back in the United States as \"Mambo Jambo\". The single was a hit, which caused Perez to launch a US tour. His appearances in 1951 were sell-outs and he began recording US releases for RCA Victor.\n\nPerez is the composer of such famous pieces as \"Mambo No. 5\"  and \"Mambo No. 8\". At the height of the mambo movement, in 1955, Perez hit the American charts at number one with a cha-cha version of \"Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White\" (composed by French composer Louiguy). This arrangement, featuring trumpeter Billy Regis, held the spot for 10 consecutive weeks. The song also went to number one in the UK and in Germany. Perez had first covered this title for the movie Underwater! in 1954, where Jane Russell can be seen dancing to \"Cherry Pink\". In 1958 one of Perez's own compositions, \"Patricia\", became the last record to ascend to #1 on the Jockeys and Top 100 charts, both of which gave way the following week to the then newly-introduced Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song also went to number one in Germany, and in the UK it reached number eight.\n\nHis popularity in the United States matched the peak of the first wave of interest in Latin music outside the Latino communities during the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s.[7][8] He also performed in films in the United States and Europe, as well as in Mexican cinema (Rumberas film), always with his trademark goatee and turtle-neck sweaters and vests. With the end of the 1950s, his success waned, and the years gave way to new rhythms, like rock 'n roll and then pop music. His association with RCA Victor ended in the 1960s, and his recorded output was mainly limited to smaller labels and recycled Latin-style anthologies. In the United States he was referred to as \"Prez\" Prado.\n[edit]Later life\nIn the early 1970s Perez permanently returned to his apartment off Mexico City's grand Paseo de la Reforma to live with his wife and two children, son D\u00e1maso P\u00e9rez Salinas (known as Perez Prado, Jr.) and daughter Mar\u00eda Engracia. His career in Latin America was still strong. He toured and continued to record material which was released in Mexico, South America, and Japan. He was revered as one of the reigning giants of the music industry and was a regular performer on Mexican television. In Japan, a live concert recording of his 1973 tour was released on LP in an early 4-channel format known as Quadraphonic.\nIn 1981 Perez was featured in a musical revue entitled Sun which enjoyed a long run in the Mexican capital. In 1983 his brother Pantale\u00f3n P\u00e9rez Prado died, and the press erroneously reported the death of bandleader P\u00e9rez Prado.[citation needed] His last United States appearance was in Hollywood on September 12, 1987, when he played to a packed house. This was also the year of his last recording. Persistent ill health plagued him for the next two years, and he died of a stroke in Mexico City on September 14, 1989, aged 72.\n\nDuring his lifetime, a cast of musical luminaries passed through his orchestra, including:\nAlex Acu\u00f1a, percussion\nPete Candoli, trumpet\nBeny Mor\u00e9, vocals\nJohnny Pacheco, percussion [later flute]\nArmando Peraza, percussion\nMongo Santamar\u00eda, percussion\n\n\n\"Patricia\" was later featured in\nthe striptease scene in Federico Fellini's 1960 film La Dolce Vita\nbackground music for a pool party in the 1969 film Goodbye, Columbus\nthe episode \"Some Enchanted Evening\" of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, first aired on May 13, 1990.\na long-running series of famous TV commercials for the Royal Mail in the UK (using the slogan \"I Saw This and Thought of You\") between 1996 and 2003\nthe closing credits of HBO's Real Sex series\nthe 2000 Clint Eastwood movie Space Cowboys\nHis mambo records and the joyous dancing they caused are described in a late chapter of Jack Kerouac's seminal novel, On the Road (1957).\nHis songs \"Caballo Negro\", \"Lupita\", and \"Mambo n.8\" are featured in the film Santa Sangre (1989) by Alejandro Jodorowsky.\nHis recording of \"Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)\" features in the films Deal of the Century (1983), Cookie (1989) and Parents (1989).\nIn the decade after his death, the popularity of Perez's music was on the rise again. CD reissues of his RCA recordings continue to sell steadily. \"Guaglione\" peaked at number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in 1995,[6] following its use in the Guinness television commercial Anticipation.\n \"Mambo No. 5\" was featured in another Guinness commercial in 1999, the same year Lou Bega took his sampled cover version of that same song to the top of the UK chart, \nThe soundtrack to the 1999 movie Office Space features two of his performances, \"Mambo No. 8\" and \"The Peanut Vendor.\"\nThe soundtrack to the 2004 movie Diarios de Motocicleta features Perez's \"Qu\u00e9 rico el mambo\", more commonly known as \"Mambo Jambo\".\nAvant-garde musician Nurse With Wound released a compilation entitled Funeral Music for Perez Prado in 2001. The album's title track exceeds 30 minutes.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/P%C3%A9rez+Prado\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

This small influx of cash enabled the production of a trio of vinyl albums with the Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson jazz trio.\n\nThis steady production of somewhat experimental acoustic music attracted the attention of Americana luminaries Will Oldham and Jonathan Donahue, and a contract with the Dolores Recordings branch of Virgin Records followed. The first album on this label, Soul Rush with backing from the Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson trio attracted some limited attention in 2001, but the next album, 2003's Tranquil Isolation, achieved widespread, especially thanks to its input from Will Oldham.\n\nA third album, Here's My Song, You Can Have It followed in 2004.\n\nHe is currently touring the USA with Mercury Rev.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nicolai+Dunger\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Neko vrijeme radi u Vjesniku, a zatim u Zagreb filmu kao crta\u010dica i scenograf.

Conventionom (uklju\u010div\u0161i vokalnu verziju Prohasnike \"Intime\"), Gabi Novak uvijek je podsje\u0107ala kako je njezin vokalni stil deriviran iz popularnog jazza na tragu Doris Day, Peggy Lee i Helen Merrill.\n\nPremda je u sedamdesete u\u0161la hitom Hrvoja Hegedu\u0161i\u0107a \"Gazi dragi, srce moje\", to desetlje\u0107e obilje\u017eila je osobnom i profesionalnom vezom s Arsenom Dedi\u0107em koja traje do danas.

Nonetheless, his compositions have been performed by a number of artists, including Teenage Fanclub, This Mortal Coil, The Bangles, Wilco, Graham Coxon, Garbage, Tom Bradbury, Son Volt, Counting Crows, Elliott Smith, Jeff Buckley, Superdrag, Evan Dando, Cat Power, Yo La Tengo, Placebo, Xiu Xiu, and His Name Is Alive.

At that time no one could have imagined that his voice would one day become the most perfect expression of the word \u201clove\u201d.\n\nAny attempt to analyse  the \u201cParios Phenomenon\u201d, his enormous appeal to the public and the hundreds of thousands of record sales (all his releases have won both gold and platinum discs), will show that his success is the result of his constant search for lyrics and music which contribute to his own growth as an artist, which promote his art and which will stand the test of time.  Most of Yannis Parios\u2019 time is spent on his work, which he approaches with dedication and respect.\n\nHis great talent, then, in conjunction with these factors explains why Parios has managed to break new ground in the love song, to gain the recognition of the general public and to have his songs on everyone\u2019s lips.  His popularity is constantly increasing and Parios is one of the very few singers who does not need a constant string of hit recordings to maintain his fame.\n\n\u201cWhenever a song is born\u201d, says Yannis Parios - and this is one of his most deep-seated beliefs - \u201dand wherever it is sung (in France, Italy, or anywhere else), it belongs to everyone.  That, really, is the reason why music exists:  so that it cannot be fenced in by frontiers\u201d.\n\nWith that consideration in mind, Yannis Parios was the first Greek singer to perform Alain Barriere\u2019s song \u201cTu t\u2019en vas\u201d with Greek lyrics.  Under its new title \u201cTora pia\u201d; the song was a gigantic hit, on an unprecedented scale for the time, and it marked the beginning of a new age in which many Greek singers adapted \u201cforeign\u201d melodies to Greek lyrics.\n\nYannis Parios has worked with many of the leading Greek composers, including Greek composers, including Manos Loizos, Yorgos Hadzinasios, Stavros Xarchakos, Stamatis Spanoudakis, Yorgos Katsaros, Marios Tokas, Yannis Spanos and Alaxis Papadimitriou.  He writes lyrics of his own, and often composes music, too.  Quite a number of his songs have been translated and sung abroad.  One of his releases holds the record for Greek sales:  this was the album \u201cNisiotika\u201d, released in 1982 and consisting of a collection of songs of the Aegean islands which, as an islander himself, he learnt and first sang in childhood.\n\nYannis Parios does not confine his appearances to Greece:  he has sung at the Albert Hall, the Carnegie Hall and the largest theatres in Canada and Australia.  He has also appeared on radio and TV programs with very high viewing and listening rates. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Giannis+Parios\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Lanon songs are a kind of folk songs from Bangladesh and Bengali areas.\n\nFarida Parveen was born in 1954 in Natore, Bangladesh and was brought up in Kushtia. In 1968 she was enlisted with Rajshahi Betar as a Nazrul singer. Though she started her career with Nazrul Geeti, Farida attained popularity in 1973 when she performed the patriotic song Ei Padma ei Meghna and the Lalon song Shatyo bol shupothey chol. Throughout an outstanding carrier she has enchanted music lovers with songs like Tomra bhulei gechho Mallikadir naam, Nindar kanta jodi and several Lalon classics. She had travelled to many countries promoting and upholding our heritage of rich folk music. As an ambassador of Lalon songs she has gained huge appreciation.\n\nFarida Parveen has been singing for more than thirty years with her singularity mellifluous voice, which flows just as the one thousand and one rivers of her sonar(golden) Bangla. Her inimitable style, her interpretation of the diverse moods of the songs and subtle tonal variations amply bring out the inner meaning of these songs. Farida has helped restore to the quintessential elements of Baul tradition : its simplicity of approach, its celebration of joy and its enlightened yet intimate understanding of the relations between the body and soul. Listening to Farida rendition of Lalon immortal songs is thus a pure experience. Among the proponents of Lalon geeti, Farida Parveen is particularly worth mentioning for her extensive work in modernising tunes. She also supports the anti-poverty campaign in Bangladesh.\n\nShe completed graduation from Kushtia Govt. College under Rajshahi University.\nIn 2008, she won the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize[4] for Best Music in Japan. In 1987, she received Ekushey Padak(one of the highest civilian awards in Bangladesh), and in 1993, she was given the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Farida+Parveen\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

Along with a successful recording career in the 1960s, Hill hosted several hit UK TV shows during the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nHill first sang professionally in a public house called The Prospect in Margate, Kent, when he was seventeen years old. He did not become a full-time musician after he had worked as baker, truck driver and coal miner. His first lucky break as a singer came when he read an advert in the 'Melody Maker' magazine, which said The Band of the Royal Corps Of Signals needed a vocalist. After completing his military service, he toured with the musical 'Florodora', and he then became a singer with Teddy Foster's Band, a big band based in London. At the beginning of the 1960s, Hill joined the critically acclaimed British vocal group, The Raindrops, which gave him his first opportunity to perform in television and radio shows, especially on the BBC radio show 'Parade of the Pops'. \n\nBy late 1961, Hill left The Raindrops for a fledgling solo career. His debut entry in the UK Singles Chart was the Vandyke penned 'The River's Run Dry', which went to No. 41 in June 1962. In January 1965, Hill was offered an international recording contract with the EMI group, which signed him to their Columbia label. His first Top 20 chart success with his new label came a year later with 'Take Me To Your Heart Again', Hill's cover of the \u00c9dith Piaf hit, 'La Vie En Rose', which climbed to no. 13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1966. His most successful hit was his cover recording of the Rodgers and Hammerstein song 'Edelweiss', from their 1959 musical 'The Sound of Music'. The recording was a no. 2 hit in the UK Singles Chart in March 1967. It was to become his signature tune for the rest of his career,\n\nHill's long-term recording contract with EMI Columbia came to an end in 1974, by which time he had released 14 studio albums and countless singles. The following year, Hill signed a new recording deal with CBS Records, for whom he released a further three studio albums of contemporary song material. Hill hosted several hit UK TV shows during the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, Hill concentrated mainly on his live performances. Hill came out of semi-retirement in April 2012 to make a successful return to the stage for one night only in which he performed in a big band night at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Vince+Hill\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

She was born Anu\u0161ka \u017dnider\u0161i\u010d on March 30, 1969, in Bre\u017eice. Derenda represented Slovenia at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2001 in Copenhagen, Denmark, where she took 7th place.\n\nAt the age of two and a half, Nu\u0161a Derenda made her parents aware of her singing talent. She always loved to sing and perform in front of an audience. Music was an integral part of her entire childhood. She sang in choruses, performed as a soloist, attended music school and learned to play the accordion. Shortly before finishing the 9-year elementary school, Nu\u0161a Derenda joined a band of young musicians.\n\nAlthough she wanted to become a pre-school teacher and worked part time in a nursery school for one year, she continued to sing with the band and travelled throughout Europe. In 1990, the band she was with broke up and Nu\u0161a Derenda and Frenk established a new one. By that time they had already become quite professional and toured Slovenia, Germany, Switzerland and were invited to the States three times. It lasted seven years, seven years of wonderful experiences and hard work at the same time, as they had up to 150 concerts a year. Since 1998, Nu\u0161a Derenda has been mostly working with a group called Happy Hour. They often accompany her at concerts.\n\nIn 2001, thanks to her Eurovision performance, she visited the International Pop Festival GOLDEN STAG in Bra\u015fov, Romania. There, she won a special prize from the Ministry of Culture for best interpretation. Nu\u0161a also visited Germany at Eurosong Fan Club Party in Cologne where she also held a solo concert. At the end of October 2001, she was invited to Croatia to Zadarfest. There she was awarded second place by the professional jury, and the prize for the best lyrics.\n\n2001 also brought her Victor of Popularity in the music category, which is presented every year by the magazine Stop: the winner is selected by its readers. Also that year, she received Zlati petelin (Golden Rooster) for the song Ni mi \u017eal (I'm Not Sorry).\n\nNu\u0161a became one of the candidates for the The Slovene Woman of the Year 2001. 2002 was marked by victory at Slovenska popevka (Slovene Pop Contest) with a song Pesek v o\u010di (Deception). At the beginning of December 2002, she released her third CD with a title Na \u0161tiri o\u010di (In Private).\n\nIn 2003, Nu\u0161a again attended the HIT Festival - the third in succession - and won with the song V ogenj zdaj obleci me (Dress Me With Fire). The song won the prize from professional jury for the best music and lyrics.\n\nHer Greatest Hits Collection 1998-2003 (Najve\u010dji uspehi 1998\/2003) was released in April 2004. The CD contains most of the popular songs from the beginning of her career to her latest tracks to date of release.\n\nOn September 5 that year, she hosted Slovenska popevka 2004 (Slovene Song 2004) at Krianke in Ljubljana and successfully passed the challenge of TV host.\n \n\nEurovision Song Contest 2001 - Copenhagen\nEntyr for Slovenia\n\nPerformer: Nu\u009aa Derenda\nSong title: Energy\nSong writer(s): Lucienne Lonchina\nSong composer(s): Matjaz Vla\u009aic \n\nSang in Position:  17\nFinal Position: 7\nTotal Points:  70\n\n23 countries participated in the 2001 Eurovision Song Contest. Bosnia & Herzegovina, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Lithuania and Greece returned to the contest, replacing the seven countries with the lowest average result in the past five contests: Romania, Switzerland, FYR Macedonia, Finland, Belgium, Austria and Cyprus.\n\nThe spectator record from the previous year in Stockholm was already broken in 2001 again: nearly 35,000 spectators saw the live show in the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen! France, Greece and Slovenia were predicted to win this year but it took everyone by surprise that it was Estonia ending up with the trophy. Tanel Padar and Aruba-born Dave Benton's pop-funk entry Everybody convinced the TV audience in the 23 countries.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union introduced a new rule this year: Only the top 15 countries and the so called 'Big Four' (Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and France) could participate in the 2002 contest - alongside the the countries that had to stay at home for the 2001 event.\n\nThe Danish national broadcaster had to cope with major challenges. Just like other host countries in the past, they worried they could not afford to host the contest and also wondered about finding a suitable venue. In the end, Danish TV picked a football stadium and - especially for the Eurovision Song Contest - a roof was built over Parken Stadium. It still ranks as the biggest-ever Eurovision Song Contest venue with room for 40,000. However, this in turn was again a problem: Most of the audience could not see the performers because they were too far away from the stage.\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/+noredirect\/NU%C5%A0A+DERENDA\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

His death was an emotional event for both Greece and its diaspora; the obituaries gave full appreciations of his life and his importance.\n\nHis death saw Greece and its millions of migrants scattered all over the world, with whom Kazantzidis had formed an amazing bond through his words, shed tears, for in Stelios they had a means of expression. His music captured their feelings in a period which forever would change Greece.\n\nFor example, a sample of his work translated amounts to, \"The bread of foreign lands is bitter, the water isn't clear and the mattresses are hard (i.e. uncomfortable)\". Here the words of Kazantzidis are being used metaphorically to represent the feeling of \"isolation\" and \"loneliness\" experienced by a typical Greek victim of \"diaspora\".\n\nHe was considered by many as the most prolific and stirring singer of Greek popular music, or La\u00efk\u00f3, and he worked with many of Greece's most renowned composers and writers. One of the first composers he ever worked with described his voice as \"made for expressing anguish\". <a href=\"https:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Stelios+Kazantzidis\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.

The Band currently consists of the sisters Christina Llanos (guitar\/vocals) and Amparo Llanos (guitar), Jes\u00fas Ant\u00fanez (drums), and Samuel Titos (bass) who recently replaced former bassist \u00c1lvaro D\u00edez. Their music ranges from heavy to sweet, shouting to dreaming, but always with a groovy drive.\n\nDover originated in the outskirts of Madrid at the beginning of the 1990s when the Llanos sisters decided to form a rock band encouraged by the alternative scene from Seattle. In 1994, the drummer Jes\u00fas Ant\u00fanez and the bass guitarist \u00c1lvaro G\u00f3mez joined in. One of the band's demo tapes reached the radio program Disco Grande on RNE Radio 3. The band then entered into a one-year contract with the small independent record label Everlasting-Caroline. Their debut album Sister in 1995 lacked promotion and sold poorly; however, the Spanish fanzine Mondo Sonoro included it among the 10 best national albums of the year.\n\nAfter their initial contract expired, they signed with the independent label Subterfuge Records, which produced their second album Devil Came To Me. This album turned out to be an unprecedented success in the Spanish independent scene. A fragment from the title song was included in a popular Radical Fruit Company television commercial and the band got launched to national fame. While promoting this album, the bass guitarist was replaced by \u00c1lvaro D\u00edez, who had already been part of the band at its beginning. The album sold over 500,000 copies and gained them fans also abroad in Europe and the Americas.\n\nTheir relationship with Subterfuge Records deteriorated and they signed with Chrysalis Records. In 1998, the band created their own label Loli Jackson Records. The next year they recorded their third album Late At Night in Seattle.\n\nIn 2000, they received the MTV Europe Best Spanish Artist award. In 2001, Chrysalis re-released their first album Sister including a bonus unreleased song Noche tras noche. In September that year, after tense recording sessions in Los Angeles marked by disagreements with their album producer Barret Jones, the band released their fourth album I Was Dead For 7 Weeks In The City Of Angels.\n\nIn 2003, they released The Flame, recorded in Spain and produced by Rick Will, an album that shows all the fury that has made them big without forgetting those great songs of melody and quality. Stephen Marcussen (Marcussen Mastering, NYC) did the mastering, a classic that has mastered a lot of the legendary records of the last 15 years.\n\nIn 2006, Dover released Follow the City Lights. It was recorded at PKO Studios and self-produced along with Daniel Alcover. The album was preceded by the single Let Me Out, and broke away from their usual sound to create a more dance-like style.\n\nThe band's 2007 release  2  is a greatest hits compilation, which exhibits the rock sound that brought them to stardom, as well as the band's new electronic sound.\n\nThe first single from  2  is entitled \"Soldier.\"\n\n2) An artist associated with the doujin circle Tokyo Audio Waffle, or en;dolphinrecords.

Flint and Dewey had been in school bands together, and when the two moved to London in the autumn of 1990 met Brown who completed the line-up.\nThe band, after attracting attention from several record labels, signed to the Virgin records subsidiary Hut Records in the summer of 1991. The band quickly picked up a following, supporting the likes of Chapterhouse, Slowdive, Teenage Fanclub and Blur, and gained a lot of press coverage, most notably in NME, Melody Maker and The Face. Their first single, \"Heaven Sent An Angel\" topped the UK independent charts, as did the follow-up \"Crimson\", and the third single \"Venice\". The band specialised in bright, abrasive guitar-pop songs with strong melodies, and were determined (but ultimately failed) to distinguish themselves from the other guitar bands of the era. The UK press lumped them in with the shoegazer movement, a tag that the band weren't comfortable with.\nA compilation of these first 3 singles was released in the States as \"Baby's Angry\" on Caroline Records, and gained the band airplay on US college radio. The band toured America in the autumn of 1992, on a co-headlining tour with fellow Caroline Records act Drop Nineteens.\nIn 1993, Revolver released the single \"Cradle Snatch\", closely followed by the album \"Cold Water Flat\", and while the songs were more sophisticated than their earlier work, the sales weren't as impressive, and Virgin dropped the band after a final single \"I Wear Your Chain\" failed to make the top 75. The band split up at the beginning of 1994, after failing to sign a deal with another label. Mat Flint went on to play bass guitar for Death In Vegas from 1996 onwards, and has released two singles, \"Commodity\" and \"Time To Kill\", with his new band Deep Cut. Deep Cut's debut album \"My Thoughts Light Fires\" will be released on Club AC30 Records in February 2009.\n\n2) Formed in Braunschweig, Germany - Formed by guitarist Lutz Buck and drummer Antek Rudo, and after tossing some ideas around, they decided to book a studio to record an album.

Their style is best described as rock and roll with strong retro influences, particularly The Who and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\n4) Revolver (Slovenia) was a thrash metal band from Portoro\u017e, active in the 90's. They have released  first and only album \"Sistem\" in 1997.
